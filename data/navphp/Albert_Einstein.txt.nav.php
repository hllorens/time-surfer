	<span id="sent0">Albert Einstein was born on 14 March 1879. </span>

	<span id="sent1">He died on 18 April 1955. </span>

	<span id="sent2">He was a theoretical physicist, philosopher and author who is widely regarded as one of the most influential and best known scientists and intellectuals of all time. </span>

	<span id="sent3">A German-Swiss Nobel laureate, he is often regarded as the father of modern physics. </span>

	<span id="sent4">He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics ``for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect''.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent5">His many contributions to physics include the special and general theories of relativity, the founding of relativistic cosmology, the first post-Newtonian expansion, the explanation of the perihelion precession of Mercury, the prediction of the deflection of light by gravity ( gravitational lensing), the first fluctuation dissipation theorem which explained the Brownian motion of molecules, the photon theory and the wave-particle duality, the quantum theory of atomic motion in solids, the zero-point energy concept, the semi-classical version of the Schrodinger equation, and the quantum theory of a monatomic gas which predicted Bose -Einstein condensation.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent6">Einstein published more than 300 scientific and over 150 non-scientific works; he additionally wrote and commentated prolifically on various philosophical and political subjects. </span>

	<span id="sent7">His great intelligence and originality has made the word ``Einstein'' synonymous with genius.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent8">Biography.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent9">Early life and education.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent10">Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Wurttemberg in the German Empire on 14 March 1879. </span>

	<span id="sent11">His father was Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer. </span>

	<span id="sent12">His mother was Pauline Einstein (nee Koch). </span>

	<span id="sent13">In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where his father and his uncle founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent14">The Einsteins were non-observant Jews. </span>

	<span id="sent15">Their son attended a Catholic elementary school from the age of five until ten. </span>

	<span id="sent16">Although Einstein had early speech difficulties, he was a top student in elementary school.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent17">His father once showed him a pocket compass; Einstein realized that there must be something causing the needle to move, despite the apparent empty space. </span>

	<span id="sent18">As he grew, Einstein built models and mechanical devices for fun and began to show a talent for mathematics. </span>

	<span id="sent19">In 1889, Max Talmud (later changed to Max Talmey) introduced the ten-year old Einstein to key texts in science, mathematics and philosophy, including Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and Euclid's Elements (which Einstein called the ``holy little geometry book''). </span>

	<span id="sent20">Talmud was a poor Jewish medical student from Poland. </span>

	<span id="sent21">The Jewish community arranged for Talmud to take meals with the Einsteins each week on Thursdays for six years. </span>

	<span id="sent22">During this time Talmud wholeheartedly guided Einstein through many secular educational interests.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent23">In 1894, his father's company failed: direct current (DC) lost the War of Currents to alternating current (AC). </span>

	<span id="sent24">In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and then, a few months later, to Pavia. </span>

	<span id="sent25">When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. </span>

	<span id="sent26">His father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering, but Einstein clashed with authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. </span>

	<span id="sent27">He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought were lost in strict rote learning. </span>

	<span id="sent28">In the spring of 1895, he withdrew to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor's note. </span>

	<span id="sent29">During this time, Einstein wrote his first scientific work, ``The Investigation of the State of Aether in Magnetic Fields''.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent30">Einstein applied directly to the Eidgenossische Polytechnische Schule (ETH) in Zurich, Switzerland. </span>

	<span id="sent31">Lacking the requisite Matura certificate, he took an entrance examination, which he failed, although he got exceptional marks in mathematics and physics. </span>

	<span id="sent32">The Einsteins sent Albert to Aarau, in northern Switzerland to finish secondary school. </span>

	<span id="sent33">While lodging with the family of Professor Jost Winteler, he fell in love with the family's daughter, Marie. </span>

	<span id="sent34">(His sister Maja later married the Winteler son, Paul.) </span>

	<span id="sent35">In Aarau, Einstein studied Maxwell's electromagnetic theory. </span>

	<span id="sent36">At age 17, he graduated, and, with his father's approval, renounced his citizenship in the German Kingdom of Wurttemberg to avoid military service, and enrolled in 1896 in the mathematics and physics program at the Polytechnic in Zurich. </span>

	<span id="sent37">Marie Winteler moved to Olsberg, Switzerland for a teaching post.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent38">In the same year, Einstein's future wife, Mileva Maric, also entered the Polytechnic to study mathematics and physics, the only woman in the academic cohort. </span>

	<span id="sent39">Over the next few years, Einstein and Maric's friendship developed into romance. </span>

	<span id="sent40">In a letter to her, Einstein called Maric a creature who is my equal and who is as strong and independent as I am. </span>

	<span id="sent41">Einstein graduated in 1900 from the Polytechnic with a diploma in mathematics and physics; Although historians have debated whether Maric influenced Einstein's work, the majority of academic historians of science agree that she did not.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent42">Marriages and children.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent43">In early 1902, Einstein and Mileva Maric had a daughter they named Lieserl in their correspondence, who was born in Novi Sad where Maric's parents lived. </span>

	<span id="sent44">Her full name is not known, and her fate is uncertain after 1903.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent45">Einstein and Maric married in January 1903. </span>

	<span id="sent46">In May 1904, the couple's first son, Hans Albert Einstein, was born in Bern, Switzerland. </span>

	<span id="sent47">Their second son, Eduard, was born in Zurich in July 1910. </span>

	<span id="sent48">In 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin, while his wife remained in Zurich with their sons. </span>

	<span id="sent49">Maric and Einstein divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent50">Einstein married Elsa Lowenthal (nee Einstein) on 2 June 1919, after having had a relationship with her since 1912. </span>

	<span id="sent51">She was his first cousin maternally and his second cousin paternally. </span>

	<span id="sent52">In 1933, they emigrated permanently to the United States. </span>

	<span id="sent53">In 1935, Elsa Einstein was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems and died in December 1936.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent54">Patent office.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent55">After graduating, Einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post, but a former classmate's father helped him secure a job in Bern, at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property, the patent office, as an assistant examiner. </span>

	<span id="sent56">He evaluated patent applications for electromagnetic devices. </span>

	<span id="sent57">In 1903, Einstein's position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent, although he was passed over for promotion until he ``fully mastered machine technology''.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent58">Much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical-mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent59">With friends he met in Bern, Einstein formed a weekly discussion club on science and philosophy, which he jokingly named ``The Olympia Academy.'' </span>

	<span id="sent60">Their readings included the works of Henri Poincare, Ernst Mach, and David Hume, which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent61">Academic career.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent62">In 1901, Einstein had a paper on the capillary forces of a straw published in the prestigious Annalen der Physik. </span>

	<span id="sent63">On 30 April 1905, he completed his thesis, with Alfred Kleiner, Professor of Experimental Physics, serving as pro-forma advisor. </span>

	<span id="sent64">Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. </span>

	<span id="sent65">His dissertation was entitled ``A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions''. </span>

	<span id="sent66">That same year, which has been called Einstein's annus mirabilis or ``miracle year'', he published four groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of matter and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent67">By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist, and he was appointed lecturer at the University of Berne. </span>

	<span id="sent68">The following year, he quit the patent office and the lectureship to take the position of physics docent at the University of Zurich. </span>

	<span id="sent69">He became a full professor at Karl-Ferdinand University in Prague in 1911. </span>

	<span id="sent70">In 1914, he returned to Germany after being appointed director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics (1914 -1932) and a professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin, although with a special clause in his contract that freed him from most teaching obligations. </span>

	<span id="sent71">He became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. </span>

	<span id="sent72">In 1916, Einstein was appointed president of the German Physical Society (1916 -1918).<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent73">In 1911, he had calculated that, based on his new theory of general relativity, light from another star would be bent by the Sun's gravity. </span>

	<span id="sent74">That prediction was claimed confirmed by observations made by a British expedition led by Sir Arthur Eddington during the solar eclipse of May 29, 1919. </span>

	<span id="sent75">International media reports of this made Einstein world famous. </span>

	<span id="sent76">On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper The Times printed a banner headline that read: Revolution in Science - New Theory of the Universe - Newtonian Ideas Overthrown. </span>

	<span id="sent77">(Much later, questions were raised whether the measurements were accurate enough to support Einstein's theory.)<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent78">In 1921, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. </span>

	<span id="sent79">Because relativity was still considered somewhat controversial, it was officially bestowed for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. </span>

	<span id="sent80">He also received the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 1925.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent81">Travels abroad.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent82">Einstein visited New York City for the first time on 2 April 1921. </span>

	<span id="sent83">When asked where he got his scientific ideas, Einstein explained that he believed scientific work best proceeds from an examination of physical reality and a search for underlying axioms, with consistent explanations that apply in all instances and avoid contradicting each other. </span>

	<span id="sent84">He also recommended theories with visualizable results.( Einstein 1954)<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent85">In 1922, he traveled throughout Asia and later to Palestine, as part of a six-month excursion and speaking tour. </span>

	<span id="sent86">His travels included Singapore, Ceylon, and Japan, where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of Japanese. </span>

	<span id="sent87">His first lecture in Tokyo lasted four hours, after which he met the emperor and empress at the Imperial Palace where thousands came to watch. </span>

	<span id="sent88">Einstein later gave his impressions of the Japanese in a letter to his sons:<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent89">On his return voyage, he also visited Palestine for twelve days in what would become his only visit to that region. </span>

	<span id="sent90">``He was greeted with great British pomp, as if he were a head of state rather than a theoretical physicist,'' writes Isaacson. </span>

	<span id="sent91">This included a cannon salute upon his arrival at the residence of the British high commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel. </span>

	<span id="sent92">During one reception given to him, the building was ``stormed by throngs who wanted to hear him.'' </span>

	<span id="sent93">In Einstein's talk to the audience, he expressed his happiness over the event:<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent94">Emigration to the United States.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent95">In 1933, Einstein was compelled to emigrate to the United States due to the rise to power of the Nazis under Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler. </span>

	<span id="sent96">While visiting American universities in April, 1933, he learned that the new German government passed a law barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities. </span>

	<span id="sent97">A month later, notes Einstein biographer, Walter Isaacson, ``a parade of swastica-wearing students and beer-hall thugs carrying torches tossed books into a huge bonfire. </span>

	<span id="sent98">Ordinary citizens poured forth carrying volumes looted from libraries and private homes. </span>

	<span id="sent99">'Jewish intellectualism is dead,' propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, his face fiery, yelled from the podium.`` </span>

	<span id="sent100">Einstein also learned that his name was on a list of assassination targets, with a ``$5,000 bounty on his head.'' </span>

	<span id="sent101">One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, ``not yet hanged''.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent102">In 1935, Einstein traveled to the United States via Albania. </span>

	<span id="sent103">He stayed in Durres for three days as a guest of the Albanian royal mansion. </span>

	<span id="sent104">Equipped with an Albanian passport, he continued his journey to the United States. </span>

	<span id="sent105">The gesture of the Albanian royalty of King Zog is said to be part of the traditional Albanian besa (honor), according to which many Jews (including Einstein) were saved from Nazi forces prior to and during World War II.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent106">Among other German scientists forced to flee were fourteen Nobel laureates and twenty-six of the sixty professors of theoretical physics in the country. </span>

	<span id="sent107">Among the other scientists who left Germany, or the other countries it came to dominate, were Edward Teller, Niels Bohr, Enrico Fermi, Otto Stern, Victor Weisskopf, Hans Bethe, and Lise Meitner, many of whom made certain that the Allies would develop nuclear weapons first, before the Nazis. </span>

	<span id="sent108">With so many other Jewish scientists now forced by circumstances to live in America, often working side by side, Einstein wrote to a friend, ``For me the most beautiful thing is to be in contact with a few fine Jews -a few millennia of a civilized past do mean something after all.'' </span>

	<span id="sent109">In another letter he writes, ``In my whole life I have never felt so Jewish as now.''<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent110">He took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, New Jersey, an affiliation that lasted until his death in 1955. </span>

	<span id="sent111">There, he tried unsuccessfully to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics. </span>

	<span id="sent112">He and Kurt Godel, another Institute member, became close friends. </span>

	<span id="sent113">They would take long walks together discussing their work. </span>

	<span id="sent114">His last assistant was Bruria Kaufman, who later became a renowned physicist.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent115">Just prior to the beginning of World War II in Europe, Einstein was persuaded to lend his enormous prestige by writing a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt on August 2, 1939, alerting him to the possibility that Nazi Germany might be developing an atomic bomb. </span>

	<span id="sent116">According to weapons historians, the letter was ``arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II.'' </span>

	<span id="sent117">As a result of Einstein's letter, the U.S. entered the ``race'' to develop the bomb first, drawing on its ``immense material, financial, and scientific resources.'' </span>

	<span id="sent118">It became the only country to develop an atomic bomb during World War II.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent119">He became an American citizen in 1940. </span>

	<span id="sent120">Not long after settling into his career at Princeton, he expressed his appreciation of the ``meritocracy'' in American culture when compared to Europe. </span>

	<span id="sent121">According to Isaacson, he recognized the ``right of individuals to say and think what they pleased,'' without social barriers, and as result, the individual was ``encouraged'' to be more creative, a trait he valued from his own early education. </span>

	<span id="sent122">Einstein writes:<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent123">As a member of the NAACP at Princeton who campaigned for the civil rights of African Americans, Einstein corresponded with civil rights activist W. E. B. Du Bois, and in 1946 Einstein called racism America's ``worst disease''. </span>

	<span id="sent124">He later stated, ``the only remedies are enlightenment and education''.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent125">After the death of Israel's first president, Chaim Weizmann, in November 1952, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the position of President of Israel, a mostly ceremonial post. </span>

	<span id="sent126">The offer was presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer ``embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons.'' </span>

	<span id="sent127">However, Einstein declined, and writes in his response that he was ``deeply moved,'' and ``at once saddened and ashamed'' that he could not accept it:<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent128">Death.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent129">On April 17, 1955, Albert Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Dr. Rudolph Nissen in 1948. </span>

	<span id="sent130">He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the State of Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live long enough to complete it. </span>

	<span id="sent131">Einstein refused surgery, saying: ``I want to go when I want. </span>

	<span id="sent132">It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. </span>

	<span id="sent133">I have done my share, it is time to go. </span>

	<span id="sent134">I will do it elegantly.`` </span>

	<span id="sent135">He died in Princeton Hospital early the next morning at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent136">Einstein's remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered around the grounds of the Institute for Advanced Study. </span>

	<span id="sent137">During the autopsy, the pathologist of Princeton Hospital, Thomas Stoltz Harvey removed Einstein's brain for preservation, without the permission of his family, in hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made Einstein so intelligent.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent138">Scientific career.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent139">Throughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles. </span>

	<span id="sent140">Most were about physics, but a few expressed leftist political opinions about pacifism, socialism, and zionism. </span>

	<span id="sent141">In addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the Bose -Einstein statistics, the Einstein refrigerator and others.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent142">Physics in 1900.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent143">Einstein's early papers all come from attempts to demonstrate that atoms exist and have a finite nonzero size. </span>

	<span id="sent144">At the time of his first paper in 1902, it was not yet completely accepted by physicists that atoms were real, even though chemists had good evidence ever since Antoine Lavoisier's work a century earlier. </span>

	<span id="sent145">The reason physicists were skeptical was because no 19th century theory could fully explain the properties of matter from the properties of atoms.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent146">Ludwig Boltzmann was a leading 19th century atomist physicist, who had struggled for years to gain acceptance for atoms. </span>

	<span id="sent147">Boltzmann had given an interpretation of the laws of thermodynamics, suggesting that the law of entropy increase is statistical. </span>

	<span id="sent148">In Boltzmann's way of thinking, the entropy is the logarithm of the number of ways a system could be configured inside. </span>

	<span id="sent149">The reason the entropy goes up is only because it is more likely for a system to go from a special state with only a few possible internal configurations to a more generic state with many. </span>

	<span id="sent150">While Boltzmann's statistical interpretation of entropy is universally accepted today, and Einstein believed it, at the turn of the 20th century it was a minority position.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent151">The statistical idea was most successful in explaining the properties of gases. </span>

	<span id="sent152">James Clerk Maxwell, another leading atomist, had found the distribution of velocities of atoms in a gas, and derived the surprising result that the viscosity of a gas should be independent of density. </span>

	<span id="sent153">Intuitively, the friction in a gas would seem to go to zero as the density goes to zero, but this is not so, because the mean free path of atoms becomes large at low densities. </span>

	<span id="sent154">A subsequent experiment by Maxwell and his wife confirmed this surprising prediction. </span>

	<span id="sent155">Other experiments on gases and vacuum, using a rotating slitted drum, showed that atoms in a gas had velocities distributed according to Maxwell's distribution law.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent156">In addition to these successes, there were also inconsistencies. </span>

	<span id="sent157">Maxwell noted that at cold temperatures, atomic theory predicted specific heats that are too large. </span>

	<span id="sent158">In classical statistical mechanics, every spring-like motion has thermal energy k B T on average at temperature T, so that the specific heat of every spring is Boltzmann's constant k B. A monatomic solid with N atoms can be thought of as N little balls representing N atoms attached to each other in a box grid with 3 N springs, so the specific heat of every solid is 3 Nk B, a result which became known as the Dulong -Petit law. </span>

	<span id="sent159">This law is true at room temperature, but not for colder temperatures. </span>

	<span id="sent160">At temperatures near zero, the specific heat goes to zero.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent161">Similarly, a gas made up of a molecule with two atoms can be thought of as two balls on a spring. </span>

	<span id="sent162">This spring has energy k B T at high temperatures, and should contribute an extra k B to the specific heat. </span>

	<span id="sent163">It does at temperatures of about 1000 degrees, but at lower temperature, this contribution disappears. </span>

	<span id="sent164">At zero temperature, all other contributions to the specific heat from rotations and vibrations also disappear. </span>

	<span id="sent165">This behavior was inconsistent with classical physics.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent166">The most glaring inconsistency was in the theory of light waves. </span>

	<span id="sent167">Continuous waves in a box can be thought of as infinitely many spring-like motions, one for each possible standing wave. </span>

	<span id="sent168">Each standing wave has a specific heat of k B, so the total specific heat of a continuous wave like light should be infinite in classical mechanics. </span>

	<span id="sent169">This is obviously wrong, because it would mean that all energy in the universe would be instantly sucked up into light waves, and everything would slow down and stop.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent170">These inconsistencies led some people to say that atoms were not physical, but mathematical. </span>

	<span id="sent171">Notable among the skeptics was Ernst Mach, whose positivist philosophy led him to demand that if atoms are real, it should be possible to see them directly. </span>

	<span id="sent172">Mach believed that atoms were a useful fiction, that in reality they could be assumed to be infinitesimally small, that Avogadro's number was infinite, or so large that it might as well be infinite, and k B was infinitesimally small. </span>

	<span id="sent173">Certain experiments could then be explained by atomic theory, but other experiments could not, and this is the way it will always be.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent174">Einstein opposed this position. </span>

	<span id="sent175">Throughout his career, he was a realist. </span>

	<span id="sent176">He believed that a single consistent theory should explain all observations, and that this theory would be a description of what was really going on, underneath it all. </span>

	<span id="sent177">So he set out to show that the atomic point of view was correct. </span>

	<span id="sent178">This led him first to thermodynamics, then to statistical physics, and to the theory of specific heats of solids.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent179">In 1905, while he was working in the patent office, the leading German language physics journal Annalen der Physik published four of Einstein's papers. </span>

	<span id="sent180">The four papers eventually were recognized as revolutionary, and 1905 became known as Einstein's `` Miracle Year'', and the papers as the Annus Mirabilis Papers.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent181">Thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent182">Einstein's earliest papers were concerned with thermodynamics. </span>

	<span id="sent183">He wrote a paper establishing a thermodynamic identity in 1902, and a few other papers which attempted to interpret phenomena from a statistical atomic point of view.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent184">His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena. </span>

	<span id="sent185">As in Maxwell's work, the finite nonzero size of atoms leads to effects which can be observed. </span>

	<span id="sent186">This research, and the thermodynamic identity, were well within the mainstream of physics in his time. </span>

	<span id="sent187">They would eventually form the content of his PhD thesis.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent188">His first major result in this field was the theory of thermodynamic fluctuations. </span>

	<span id="sent189">When in equilibrium, a system has a maximum entropy and, according to the statistical interpretation, it can fluctuate a little bit. </span>

	<span id="sent190">Einstein pointed out that the statistical fluctuations of a macroscopic object, like a mirror suspended on spring, would be completely determined by the second derivative of the entropy with respect to the position of the mirror.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent191">Searching for ways to test this relation, his great breakthrough came in 1905. </span>

	<span id="sent192">The theory of fluctuations, he realized, would have a visible effect for an object which could move around freely. </span>

	<span id="sent193">Such an object would have a velocity which is random, and would move around randomly, just like an individual atom. </span>

	<span id="sent194">The average kinetic energy of the object would be k B T, and the time decay of the fluctuations would be entirely determined by the law of friction.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent195">The law of friction for a small ball in a viscous fluid like water was discovered by George Stokes. </span>

	<span id="sent196">He showed that for small velocities, the friction force would be proportional to the velocity, and to the radius of the particle (see Stokes' law). </span>

	<span id="sent197">This relation could be used to calculate how far a small ball in water would travel due to its random thermal motion, and Einstein noted that such a ball, of size about a micron, would travel about a few microns per second. </span>

	<span id="sent198">This motion could be easily detected with a microscope and indeed, as Brownian motion, had actually been observed by the botanist Robert Brown. </span>

	<span id="sent199">Einstein was able to identify this motion with that predicted by his theory. </span>

	<span id="sent200">Since the fluctuations which give rise to Brownian motion are just the same as the fluctuations of the velocities of atoms, measuring the precise amount of Brownian motion using Einstein's theory would show that Boltzmann's constant is non-zero and would measure Avogadro's number.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent201">These experiments were carried out a few years later by Jean Baptiste Perrin, and gave a rough estimate of Avogadro's number consistent with the more accurate estimates due to Max Planck's theory of blackbody light and Robert Millikan's measurement of the charge of the electron. </span>

	<span id="sent202">Unlike the other methods, Einstein's required very few theoretical assumptions or new physics, since it was directly measuring atomic motion on visible grains.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent203">Einstein's theory of Brownian motion was the first paper in the field of statistical physics. </span>

	<span id="sent204">It established that thermodynamic fluctuations were related to dissipation. </span>

	<span id="sent205">This was shown by Einstein to be true for time-independent fluctuations, but in the Brownian motion paper he showed that dynamical relaxation rates calculated from classical mechanics could be used as statistical relaxation rates to derive dynamical diffusion laws. </span>

	<span id="sent206">These relations are known as Einstein relations.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent207">The theory of Brownian motion was the least revolutionary of Einstein's Annus mirabilis papers, but it is the most frequently cited, and had an important role in securing the acceptance of the atomic theory by physicists.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent208">Thought experiments and a-priori physical principles.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent209">Einstein's thinking underwent a transformation in 1905. </span>

	<span id="sent210">He had come to understand that quantum properties of light mean that Maxwell's equations were only an approximation. </span>

	<span id="sent211">He knew that new laws would have to replace these, but he did not know how to go about finding those laws. </span>

	<span id="sent212">He felt that guessing formal relations would not go anywhere.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent213">So he decided to focus on a-priori principles instead, which are statements about physical laws which can be understood to hold in a very broad sense even in domains where they have not yet been shown to apply. </span>

	<span id="sent214">A well accepted example of an a-priori principle is rotational invariance. </span>

	<span id="sent215">If a new force is discovered in physics, it is assumed to be rotationally invariant almost automatically, without thought. </span>

	<span id="sent216">Einstein sought new principles of this sort, to guide the production of physical ideas. </span>

	<span id="sent217">Once enough principles are found, then the new physics will be the simplest theory consistent with the principles and with previously known laws.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent218">The first general a-priori principle he found was the principle of relativity, that uniform motion is indistinguishable from rest. </span>

	<span id="sent219">This was understood by Hermann Minkowski to be a generalization of rotational invariance from space to space-time. </span>

	<span id="sent220">Other principles postulated by Einstein and later vindicated are the principle of equivalence and the principle of adiabatic invariance of the quantum number. </span>

	<span id="sent221">Another of Einstein's general principles, Mach's principle, is fiercely debated, and whether it holds in our world or not is still not definitively established.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent222">The use of a-priori principles is a distinctive unique signature of Einstein's early work, and has become a standard tool in modern theoretical physics.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent223">Special relativity.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent224">His 1905 paper on the electrodynamics of moving bodies introduced his theory of special relativity, which showed that the observed independence of the speed of light on the observer's state of motion required fundamental changes to the notion of simultaneity. </span>

	<span id="sent225">Consequences of this include the time-space frame of a moving body slowing down and contracting (in the direction of motion) relative to the frame of the observer. </span>

	<span id="sent226">This paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether - one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time - was superfluous. </span>

	<span id="sent227">In his paper on mass -energy equivalence, which had previously been considered to be distinct concepts, Einstein deduced from his equations of special relativity what has been called the twentieth century's best-known equation: E= mc . </span>

	<span id="sent228">This equation suggests that tiny amounts of mass could be converted into huge amounts of energy and presaged the development of nuclear power. </span>

	<span id="sent229">Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with Max Planck.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent230">Photons.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent231">In a 1905 paper, Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles ( quanta). </span>

	<span id="sent232">Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. </span>

	<span id="sent233">This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of Compton scattering.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent234">Einstein's paper on the light particles was almost entirely motivated by thermodynamic considerations. </span>

	<span id="sent235">He was not at all motivated by the detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, which did not confirm his theory until fifteen years later. </span>

	<span id="sent236">Einstein considers the entropy of light at temperature T, and decomposes it into a low-frequency part and a high-frequency part. </span>

	<span id="sent237">The high-frequency part, where the light is described by Wien's law, has an entropy which looks exactly the same as the entropy of a gas of classical particles.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent238">Since the entropy is the logarithm of the number of possible states, Einstein concludes that the number of states of short wavelength light waves in a box with volume V is equal to the number of states of a group of localizable particles in the same box. </span>

	<span id="sent239">Since (unlike others) he was comfortable with the statistical interpretation, he confidently postulates that the light itself is made up of localized particles, as this is the only reasonable interpretation of the entropy.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent240">This leads him to conclude that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is Planck's constant. </span>

	<span id="sent241">He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave. </span>

	<span id="sent242">But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent243">Quantized atomic vibrations.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent244">Einstein continued his work on quantum mechanics in 1906, by explaining the specific heat anomaly in solids. </span>

	<span id="sent245">This was the first application of quantum theory to a mechanical system. </span>

	<span id="sent246">Since Planck's distribution for light oscillators had no problem with infinite specific heats, the same idea could be applied to solids to fix the specific heat problem there. </span>

	<span id="sent247">Einstein showed in a simple model that the hypothesis that solid motion is quantized explains why the specific heat of a solid goes to zero at zero temperature.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent248">Einstein's model treats each atom as connected to a single spring. </span>

	<span id="sent249">Instead of connecting all the atoms to each other, which leads to standing waves with all sorts of different frequencies, Einstein imagined that each atom was attached to a fixed point in space by a spring. </span>

	<span id="sent250">This is not physically correct, but it still predicts that the specific heat is 3 Nk B, since the number of independent oscillations stays the same.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent251">Einstein then assumes that the motion in this model is quantized, according to the Planck law, so that each independent spring motion has energy which is an integer multiple of hf, where f is the frequency of oscillation. </span>

	<span id="sent252">With this assumption, he applied Boltzmann's statistical method to calculate the average energy of the spring. </span>

	<span id="sent253">The result was the same as the one that Planck had derived for light: for temperatures where k B T is much smaller than hf, the motion is frozen, and the specific heat goes to zero.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent254">So Einstein concluded that quantum mechanics would solve the main problem of classical physics, the specific heat anomaly. </span>

	<span id="sent255">The particles of sound implied by this formulation are now called phonons. </span>

	<span id="sent256">Because all of Einstein's springs have the same stiffness, they all freeze out at the same temperature, and this leads to a prediction that the specific heat should go to zero exponentially fast when the temperature is low. </span>

	<span id="sent257">The solution to this problem is to solve for the independent normal modes individually, and to quantize those. </span>

	<span id="sent258">Then each normal mode has a different frequency, and long wavelength vibration modes freeze out at colder temperatures than short wavelength ones. </span>

	<span id="sent259">This was done by Peter Debye, and after this modification Einstein's quantization method reproduced quantitatively the behavior of the specific heats of solids at low temperatures.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent260">This work was the foundation of condensed matter physics.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent261">Adiabatic principle and action-angle variables.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent262">Throughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. </span>

	<span id="sent263">After Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the periodic table of the elements.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent264">Einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made. </span>

	<span id="sent265">Wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple shifting process. </span>

	<span id="sent266">Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. </span>

	<span id="sent267">Arnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics. </span>

	<span id="sent268">The law that the action variable is quantized was the basic principle of the quantum theory as it was known between 1900 and 1925.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent269">Wave-particle duality.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent270">Although the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. </span>

	<span id="sent271">In 1908, he became a privatdozent at the University of Bern. </span>

	<span id="sent272">In ``uber die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen uber das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung'' (`` The Development of Our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation''), on the quantization of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as independent, point-like particles. </span>

	<span id="sent273">This paper introduced the photon concept (although the name photon was introduced later by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1926) and inspired the notion of wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent274">Theory of critical opalescence.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent275">Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. </span>

	<span id="sent276">Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. </span>

	<span id="sent277">At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. </span>

	<span id="sent278">The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. </span>

	<span id="sent279">Einstein relates this to Raleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent280">Zero-point energy.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent281">Einstein's physical intuition led him to note that Planck's oscillator energies had an incorrect zero point. </span>

	<span id="sent282">He modified Planck's hypothesis by stating that the lowest energy state of an oscillator is equal to  2 hf, to half the energy spacing between levels. </span>

	<span id="sent283">This argument, which was made in 1913 in collaboration with Otto Stern, was based on the thermodynamics of a diatomic molecule which can split apart into two free atoms.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent284">Principle of equivalence.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent285">In 1907, while still working at the patent office, Einstein had what he would call his ``happiest thought''. </span>

	<span id="sent286">He realized that the principle of relativity could be extended to gravitational fields. </span>

	<span id="sent287">He thought about the case of a uniformly accelerated box not in a gravitational field, and noted that it would be indistinguishable from a box sitting still in an unchanging gravitational field. </span>

	<span id="sent288">He used special relativity to see that the rate of clocks at the top of a box accelerating upward would be faster than the rate of clocks at the bottom. </span>

	<span id="sent289">He concludes that the rates of clocks depend on their position in a gravitational field, and that the difference in rate is proportional to the gravitational potential to first approximation.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent290">Although this approximation is crude, it allowed him to calculate the deflection of light by gravity, and show that it is nonzero. </span>

	<span id="sent291">This gave him confidence that the scalar theory of gravity proposed by Gunnar Nordstrom was incorrect. </span>

	<span id="sent292">But the actual value for the deflection that he calculated was too small by a factor of two, because the approximation he used doesn't work well for things moving at near the speed of light. </span>

	<span id="sent293">When Einstein finished the full theory of general relativity, he would rectify this error and predict the correct amount of light deflection by the sun.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent294">From Prague, Einstein published a paper about the effects of gravity on light, specifically the gravitational redshift and the gravitational deflection of light. </span>

	<span id="sent295">The paper challenged astronomers to detect the deflection during a solar eclipse. </span>

	<span id="sent296">German astronomer Erwin Finlay-Freundlich publicized Einstein's challenge to scientists around the world.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent297">Einstein thought about the nature of the gravitational field in the years 1909 -1912, studying its properties by means of simple thought experiments. </span>

	<span id="sent298">A notable one is the rotating disk. </span>

	<span id="sent299">Einstein imagined an observer making experiments on a rotating turntable. </span>

	<span id="sent300">He noted that such an observer would find a different value for the mathematical constant pi than the one predicted by Euclidean geometry. </span>

	<span id="sent301">The reason is that the radius of a circle would be measured with an uncontracted ruler, but, according to special relativity, the circumference would seem to be longer because the ruler would be contracted.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent302">Since Einstein believed that the laws of physics were local, described by local fields, he concluded from this that spacetime could be locally curved. </span>

	<span id="sent303">This led him to study Riemannian geometry, and to formulate general relativity in this language.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent304">Hole argument and Entwurf theory.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent305">While developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory. </span>

	<span id="sent306">He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. </span>

	<span id="sent307">He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations, and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent308">In June, 1913 the Entwurf (``draft'') theory was the result of these investigations. </span>

	<span id="sent309">As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. </span>

	<span id="sent310">Simultaneously less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, after more than two years of intensive work Einstein abandoned the theory in November, 1915 after realizing that the hole argument was mistaken.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent311">General relativity.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent312">In 1912, Einstein returned to Switzerland to accept a professorship at his alma mater, the ETH. </span>

	<span id="sent313">Once back in Zurich, he immediately visited his old ETH classmate Marcel Grossmann, now a professor of mathematics, who introduced him to Riemannian geometry and, more generally, to differential geometry. </span>

	<span id="sent314">On the recommendation of Italian mathematician Tullio Levi-Civita, Einstein began exploring the usefulness of general covariance (essentially the use of tensors) for his gravitational theory. </span>

	<span id="sent315">For a while Einstein thought that there were problems with the approach, but he later returned to it and, by late 1915, had published his general theory of relativity in the form in which it is used today. </span>

	<span id="sent316">This theory explains gravitation as distortion of the structure of spacetime by matter, affecting the inertial motion of other matter. </span>

	<span id="sent317">During World War I, the work of Central Powers scientists was available only to Central Powers academics, for national security reasons. </span>

	<span id="sent318">Some of Einstein's work did reach the United Kingdom and the United States through the efforts of the Austrian Paul Ehrenfest and physicists in the Netherlands, especially 1902 Nobel Prize-winner Hendrik Lorentz and Willem de Sitter of Leiden University. </span>

	<span id="sent319">After the war ended, Einstein maintained his relationship with Leiden University, accepting a contract as an Extraordinary Professor; for ten years, from 1920 to 1930, he travelled to Holland regularly to lecture.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent320">In 1917, several astronomers accepted Einstein 's 1911 challenge from Prague. </span>

	<span id="sent321">The Mount Wilson Observatory in California, U.S., published a solar spectroscopic analysis that showed no gravitational redshift. </span>

	<span id="sent322">In 1918, the Lick Observatory, also in California, announced that it too had disproved Einstein's prediction, although its findings were not published.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent323">However, in May 1919, a team led by the British astronomer Arthur Stanley Eddington claimed to have confirmed Einstein's prediction of gravitational deflection of starlight by the Sun while photographing a solar eclipse with dual expeditions in Sobral, northern Brazil, and Principe, a west African island. </span>

	<span id="sent324">Nobel laureate Max Born praised general relativity as the ``greatest feat of human thinking about nature''; fellow laureate Paul Dirac was quoted saying it was ``probably the greatest scientific discovery ever made''. </span>

	<span id="sent325">The international media guaranteed Einstein's global renown.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent326">There have been claims that scrutiny of the specific photographs taken on the Eddington expedition showed the experimental uncertainty to be comparable to the same magnitude as the effect Eddington claimed to have demonstrated, and that a 1962 British expedition concluded that the method was inherently unreliable. </span>

	<span id="sent327">The deflection of light during a solar eclipse was confirmed by later, more accurate observations. </span>

	<span id="sent328">Some resented the newcomer's fame, notably among some German physicists, who later started the Deutsche Physik (German Physics) movement.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent329">Cosmology.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent330">In 1917, Einstein applied the General theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe as a whole. </span>

	<span id="sent331">He wanted the universe to be eternal and unchanging, but this type of universe is not consistent with relativity. </span>

	<span id="sent332">To fix this, Einstein modified the general theory by introducing a new notion, the cosmological constant. </span>

	<span id="sent333">With a positive cosmological constant, the universe could be an eternal static sphere<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent334">Einstein believed a spherical static universe is philosophically preferred, because it would obey Mach's principle. </span>

	<span id="sent335">He had shown that general relativity incorporates Mach's principle to a certain extent in frame dragging by gravitomagnetic fields, but he knew that Mach's idea would not work if space goes on forever. </span>

	<span id="sent336">In a closed universe, he believed that Mach's principle would hold.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent337">Mach's principle has generated much controversy over the years.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent338">Modern quantum theory.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent339">In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser. </span>

	<span id="sent340">This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. </span>

	<span id="sent341">This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws. </span>

	<span id="sent342">Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie's work, and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. </span>

	<span id="sent343">In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves, which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton -Jacobi equation of mechanics. </span>

	<span id="sent344">This paper would inspire Schrodinger's work of 1926.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent345">Bose -Einstein statistics.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent346">In 1924, Einstein received a description of a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. </span>

	<span id="sent347">Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift fur Physik. </span>

	<span id="sent348">Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose -Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures. </span>

	<span id="sent349">It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST - JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder. </span>

	<span id="sent350">Bose -Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons. </span>

	<span id="sent351">Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent352">Energy momentum pseudotensor.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent353">General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. </span>

	<span id="sent354">Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. </span>

	<span id="sent355">The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent356">Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. </span>

	<span id="sent357">He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. </span>

	<span id="sent358">This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent359">The use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by Erwin Schrodinger and others.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent360">Unified field theory.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent361">Following his research on general relativity, Einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation, which would allow the explanation of electromagnetism. </span>

	<span id="sent362">In 1950, he described his `` unified field theory'' in a Scientific American article entitled ``On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation.'' </span>

	<span id="sent363">Although he continued to be lauded for his work, Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research, and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. </span>

	<span id="sent364">In his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces, which were not well understood until many years after his death. </span>

	<span id="sent365">Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification. </span>

	<span id="sent366">Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of everything and in particular string theory, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent367">Wormholes.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent368">Einstein collaborated with others to produce a model of a wormhole. </span>

	<span id="sent369">His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper ``Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?''. </span>

	<span id="sent370">These solutions cut and pasted Schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent371">If one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged. </span>

	<span id="sent372">These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent373">Einstein -Cartan theory.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent374">In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the torsion. </span>

	<span id="sent375">This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent376">Einstein -Podolsky -Rosen paradox.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent377">In 1935, Einstein returned to the question of quantum mechanics. </span>

	<span id="sent378">He considered how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other. </span>

	<span id="sent379">He noted, along with his collaborators, that by performing different measurements on the distant particle, either of position or momentum, different properties of the entangled partner could be discovered without disturbing it in any way.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent380">He then used a hypothesis of local realism to conclude that the other particle had these properties already determined. </span>

	<span id="sent381">The principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be, without in any way disturbing the particle, then the particle actually has values of position or momentum.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent382">This principle distilled the essence of Einstein's objection to quantum mechanics. </span>

	<span id="sent383">As a physical principle, it has since been shown to be incompatible with experiments.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent384">Equations of motion.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent385">The theory of general relativity has a fundamental law  - the Einstein equations which describe how space curves, the geodesic equation which describes how particles move may be derived from the Einstein equations.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent386">Since the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law. </span>

	<span id="sent387">So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent388">This was established by Einstein, Infeld and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by Roy Kerr for spinning objects.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent389">Einstein's controversial beliefs in physics.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent390">In addition to his well-accepted results, some of Einstein's views are regarded as controversial:<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent391">Collaboration with other scientists.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent392">In addition to long time collaborators Leopold Infeld, Nathan Rosen, Peter Bergmann and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent393">Einstein-de Haas experiment.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent394">Einstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. </span>

	<span id="sent395">In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum. </span>

	<span id="sent396">They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. </span>

	<span id="sent397">This experiment needed to be sensitive, because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent398">Schrodinger gas model.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent399">Einstein suggested to Erwin Schrodinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a Bose -Einstein gas by considering a box. </span>

	<span id="sent400">Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. </span>

	<span id="sent401">Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent402">This formulation is a form of second quantization, but it predates modern quantum mechanics. </span>

	<span id="sent403">Erwin Schrodinger applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of a semiclassical ideal gas. </span>

	<span id="sent404">Schrodinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent405">Einstein refrigerator.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent406">In 1926, Einstein and his former student Leo Szilard co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the Einstein refrigerator. </span>

	<span id="sent407">This Absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input. </span>

	<span id="sent408">On 11 November 1930, U.S. Patent 1,781,541 was awarded to Albert Einstein and Leo Szilard for the refrigerator. </span>

	<span id="sent409">Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, as the most promising of their patents were quickly bought up by the Swedish company Electrolux to protect its refrigeration technology from competition.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent410">Bohr versus Einstein.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent411">In the 1920s, quantum mechanics developed into a more complete theory. </span>

	<span id="sent412">Einstein was unhappy with the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory developed by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. </span>

	<span id="sent413">In this interpretation, quantum phenomena are inherently probabilistic, with definite states resulting only upon interaction with classical systems. </span>

	<span id="sent414">A public debate between Einstein and Bohr followed, lasting on and off for many years (including during the Solvay Conferences). </span>

	<span id="sent415">Einstein formulated thought experiments against the Copenhagen interpretation, which were all rebutted by Bohr. </span>

	<span id="sent416">In a 1926 letter to Max Born, Einstein wrote: ``I, at any rate, am convinced that He [God] does not throw dice.''<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent417">Einstein was never satisfied by what he perceived to be quantum theory's intrinsically incomplete description of nature, and in 1935 he further explored the issue in collaboration with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, noting that the theory seems to require non-local interactions; this is known as the EPR paradox. </span>

	<span id="sent418">The EPR experiment has since been performed, with results confirming quantum theory's predictions. </span>

	<span id="sent419">Repercussions of the Einstein -Bohr debate have found their way into philosophical discourse.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent420">Religious views.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent421">The question of scientific determinism gave rise to questions about Einstein's position on theological determinism, and whether or not he believed in God, or in a god. </span>

	<span id="sent422">In 1929, Einstein told Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein ``I believe in Spinoza's God, who reveals Himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God Who concerns Himself with the fate and the doings of mankind.'' </span>

	<span id="sent423">In a 1954 letter, he wrote, ``I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. </span>

	<span id="sent424">In a letter to philosopher Erik Gutkind, Einstein remarked, ``The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weakness, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still purely primitive, legends which are nevertheless pretty childish.''<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent425">Repeated attempts by the press to present Albert Einstein as a religious man provoked the following statement:<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent426">Einstein had previously explored this belief, that man could not understand the nature of God, when he gave an interview to Time Magazine explaining:<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent427">Political views.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent428">Throughout the November Revolution in Germany Einstein signed an appeal for the foundation of a nationwide liberal and democratic party, which was published in the Berliner Tageblatt on 16 November 1918, and became a member of the German Democratic Party.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent429">Einstein was a socialist. </span>

	<span id="sent430">He flouted the ascendant Nazi movement and later tried to be a voice of moderation in the tumultuous formation of the State of Israel, which he supported. </span>

	<span id="sent431">He braved anti-communist politics and resistance to the civil rights movement in the United States. </span>

	<span id="sent432">He participated in the 1927 congress of the League against Imperialism in Brussels.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent433">In his article Why Socialism?, published in 1949 in the Monthly Review, Einstein described a chaotic capitalist society, a source of evil to be overcome, as the predatory phase of human development``. </span>

	<span id="sent434">He came to the following conclusion:<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent435">I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils [capitalism], namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. </span>

	<span id="sent436">In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. </span>

	<span id="sent437">A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child. </span>

	<span id="sent438">The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent439">On the floor of the US Congress, Einstein was accused by John E. Rankin of Mississippi of being a foreign-born agitator who sought to further the spread of Communism throughout the world.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent440">After World War II, as enmity between the former allies became a serious issue, Einstein wrote, I do not know how the third World War will be fought, but I can tell you what they will use in the Fourth - rocks! ( Einstein 1949) With Albert Schweitzer and Bertrand Russell, Einstein lobbied to stop nuclear testing and future bombs. </span>

	<span id="sent441">Days before his death, Einstein signed the Russell -Einstein Manifesto, which led to the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent442">Einstein was a member of several civil rights groups, including the Princeton chapter of the NAACP. </span>

	<span id="sent443">When the aged W. E. B. Du Bois was accused of being a Communist spy, Einstein volunteered as a character witness, and the case was dismissed shortly afterward. </span>

	<span id="sent444">Einstein's friendship with activist Paul Robeson, with whom he served as co-chair of the American Crusade to End Lynching, lasted twenty years.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent445">Einstein said ``Politics is for the moment, equation for the eternity'', stating that physics was more important in his life. </span>

	<span id="sent446">He declined the presidency of Israel in 1952.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent447">Non-scientific legacy.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent448">While travelling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. </span>

	<span id="sent449">The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to The Hebrew University. </span>

	<span id="sent450">Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986 ). </span>

	<span id="sent451">Barbara Wolff, of The Hebrew University's Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent452">Einstein bequeathed the royalties from use of his image to The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. </span>

	<span id="sent453">Corbis, successor to The Roger Richman Agency, licenses the use of his name and associated imagery, as agent for the university.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent454">In popular culture.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent455">In the period before World War II, Einstein was so well-known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain ``that theory.'' </span>

	<span id="sent456">He finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries. </span>

	<span id="sent457">He told his inquirers ``Pardon me, sorry! </span>

	<span id="sent458">Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein.``<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent459">Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music. </span>

	<span id="sent460">He is a favorite model for depictions of mad scientists and absent-minded professors; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated. </span>

	<span id="sent461">Time magazine's Frederic Golden wrote that Einstein was ``a cartoonist's dream come true.''<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent462">Awards and honors.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent463">In 1922, Einstein was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics, ``for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect''. </span>

	<span id="sent464">This refers to his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect, ``On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light'', which was well supported by the experimental evidence by that time. </span>

	<span id="sent465">The presentation speech began by mentioning ``his theory of relativity [which had] been the subject of lively debate in philosophical circles [and] also has astrophysical implications which are being rigorously examined at the present time.'' </span>

	<span id="sent466">( Einstein 1923)<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent467">It was long reported that Einstein gave the Nobel prize money to his first wife, Mileva Maric, in compliance with their 1919 divorce settlement. </span>

	<span id="sent468">However, personal correspondence made public in 2006 shows that he invested much of it in the United States, and saw much of it wiped out in the Great Depression.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent469">In 1936, Einstein was awarded the Franklin Institute's Franklin Medal for his extensive work on relativity and the photo-electric effect.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent470">The International Union of Pure and Applied Physics named 2005 the  World Year of Physics in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the publication of the annus mirabilis papers.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent471">The Albert Einstein Memorial in central Washington, D.C. is a monumental bronze statue depicting Einstein seated with manuscript papers in hand. </span>

	<span id="sent472">The statue, commissioned in 1979, is located in a grove of trees at the southwest corner of the grounds of the National Academy of Sciences on Constitution Avenue.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent473">The chemical element 99, einsteinium, was named for him in August 1955, four months after Einstein's death. 2001 Einstein is an inner main belt asteroid discovered on 5 March 1973.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent474">In 1999 Time magazine named him the Person of the Century, ahead of Mahatma Gandhi and Franklin Roosevelt, among others. </span>

	<span id="sent475">In the words of a biographer, to the scientifically literate and the public at large, Einstein is synonymous with genius. </span>

	<span id="sent476">Also in 1999, an opinion poll of 100 of leading physicists ranked Einstein the ``greatest physicist ever''. </span>

	<span id="sent477">A Gallup poll recorded him as the fourth most admired person of the 20th century in the U.S.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent478">In 1990, his name was added to the Walhalla temple for ``laudable and distinguished Germans'', which is located east of Regensburg, in Bavaria, Germany.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent479">The United States Postal Service honored Einstein with a Prominent Americans series (1965 -1978) 8 postage stamp.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent480">Awards named after him.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent481">The Albert Einstein Award (sometimes called the Albert Einstein Medal because it is accompanied with a gold medal) is an award in theoretical physics, established to recognize high achievement in the natural sciences. </span>

	<span id="sent482">It was endowed by the Lewis and Rosa Strauss Memorial Fund in honor of Albert Einstein's 70th birthday. </span>

	<span id="sent483">It was first awarded in 1951 and included a prize money of $15,000, which was later reduced to $5,000. </span>

	<span id="sent484">The winner is selected by a committee (the first of which consisted of Einstein, Oppenheimer, von Neumann and Weyl ) of the Institute for Advanced Study, which administers the award.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent485">The Albert Einstein Medal is an award presented by the Albert Einstein Society in Bern, Switzerland. </span>

	<span id="sent486">First given in 1979, the award is presented to people who have ``rendered outstanding services'' in connection with Einstein.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent487">The Albert Einstein Peace Prize is given yearly by the Chicago, Illinois-based Albert Einstein Peace Prize Foundation. </span>

	<span id="sent488">Winners of the prize receive $50,000.
