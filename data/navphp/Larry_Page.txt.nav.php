	<span id="sent0">Lawrence ``Larry'' Page (born March 26, 1973) is an American computer scientist and software developer who, with Sergey Brin, is best known as the co-founder of Google. </span>

	<span id="sent1">He is also the current Chief Executive Officer of Google, as announced on January 21, 2011 through a blog post. </span>

	<span id="sent2">As of 2011 , his personal wealth is estimated to be $19.8 billion.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent3">Early life and education.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent4">Page was born in East Lansing, Michigan on March 26, 1973. </span>

	<span id="sent5">His father, Carl Page, earned a Ph.D. in computer science in 1965 when the field was in its infancy, and is considered a ``pioneer in computer science and artificial intelligence.'' </span>

	<span id="sent6">Both he and Page's mother were computer science professors at Michigan State University. </span>

	<span id="sent7">Page is Jewish on his mother's side, and was raised without religion.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent8">Page attended the Okemos Montessori School (now called Montessori Radmoor) in Okemos, Michigan from 1975 to 1979, and graduated from East Lansing High School in 1991. </span>

	<span id="sent9">He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in computer engineering from the University of Michigan with honors and a Masters degree in computer science from Stanford University. </span>

	<span id="sent10">While at the University of Michigan, ``Page created an inkjet printer made of Lego bricks'' (actually a line plotter), served as the president of the HKN in Fall 1994, and was a member of the 1993 ``Maize & Blue'' University of Michigan Solar team.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent11">During an interview, Page recalled his childhood, noting that his house ``was usually a mess, with computers and Popular Science magazines all over the place.'' </span>

	<span id="sent12">His attraction to computers started when he was six years old when he got to ``play with the stuff lying around.'' </span>

	<span id="sent13">He became the ``first kid in his elementary school to turn in an assignment from a word processor.'' </span>

	<span id="sent14">His older brother also taught him to take things apart, and before long he was taking ``everything in his house apart to see how it worked.'' </span>

	<span id="sent15">He said that ``from a very early age, I also realized I wanted to invent things. </span>

	<span id="sent16">So I became really interested in technology...and business . . . probably from when I was 12, I knew I was going to start a company eventually.``<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent17">After enrolling for a Ph.D. program in computer science at Stanford University, Larry Page was in search of a dissertation theme and considered exploring the mathematical properties of the World Wide Web, understanding its link structure as a huge graph. </span>

	<span id="sent18">His supervisor Terry Winograd encouraged him to pursue this idea, which Page later recalled as ``the best advice I ever got''. </span>

	<span id="sent19">Page then focused on the problem of finding out which web pages link to a given page, considering the number and nature of such backlinks to be valuable information about that page (with the role of citations in academic publishing in mind). </span>

	<span id="sent20">In his research project, nicknamed ``BackRub'', he was soon joined by Sergey Brin, a fellow Stanford Ph.D. student.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent21">John Battelle, co-founder of Wired magazine, wrote of Page that he had reasoned that the ``entire Web was loosely based on the premise of citation  - after all, what is a link but a citation? </span>

	<span id="sent22">If he could devise a method to count and qualify each backlink on the Web, as Page puts it 'the Web would become a more valuable place'.`` </span>

	<span id="sent23">Battelle further described how Page and Brin began working together on the project:<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent24">Brin and Page originally met in March 1995, during a spring orientation of new computer Ph.D. candidates. </span>

	<span id="sent25">Brin, who had already been in the program for two years, was assigned to show some students, including Page, around campus, and they later became good friends.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent26">To convert the backlink data gathered by BackRub's web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones. </span>

	<span id="sent27">It relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the back links that connected one Web page to another. </span>

	<span id="sent28">In August 1996, the initial version of Google was made available, still on the Stanford University Web site.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent29">Business.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent30">In 1998, Brin and Page founded Google, Inc. </span>

	<span id="sent31">Page ran Google as co-president along with Brin until 2001 when they hired Eric Schmidt as Chairman and CEO of Google. </span>

	<span id="sent32">In January 2011 Google announced that Page would replace Schmidt as CEO in April the same year. </span>

	<span id="sent33">Both Page and Brin earn an annual compensation of one dollar. </span>

	<span id="sent34">On April 4, 2011, Page officially became the chief executive officer of Google, while Schmidt stepped down to become executive chairman.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent35">Personal life.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent36">Page married Lucinda Southworth at Richard Branson's Caribbean island, Necker Island in 2007. </span>

	<span id="sent37">Southworth is a research scientist and sister of actress and model Carrie Southworth. </span>

	<span id="sent38">He has one child.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent39">Other interests.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent40">Page is an active investor in alternative energy companies, such as Tesla Motors, which developed the Tesla Roadster, a 244-mile (393km) range battery electric vehicle. </span>

	<span id="sent41">He continues to be committed to renewable energy technology, and with the help of Google.org, Google's philanthropic arm, promotes the adoption of plug-in hybrid electric cars and other alternative energy investments.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent42">Brin and Page are the executive producers of the 2007 film Broken Arrows.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent43">Awards and recognition.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent44">In 2003, both Brin and Page received an honorary MBA from IE Business School ``for embodying the entrepreneurial spirit and lending momentum to the creation of new businesses....'' </span>

	<span id="sent45">And in 2004, they received the Marconi Foundation Prize, the ``Highest Award in Engineering,'' and were elected Fellows of the Marconi Foundation at Columbia University. </span>

	<span id="sent46">``In announcing their selection, John Jay Iselin, the Foundation's president, congratulated the two men for their invention that has fundamentally changed the way information is retrieved today.'' </span>

	<span id="sent47">They joined a ``select cadre of 32 of the world's most influential communications technology pioneers....'' </span>

	<span id="sent48">He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2004. </span>

	<span id="sent49">In 2005, Brin and Page were elected Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. </span>

	<span id="sent50">In 2002 the World Economic Forum named Page a Global Leader for Tomorrow and in 2004 the X PRIZE chose Page as a trustee for their board.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent51">PC Magazine has praised Google as among the Top 100 Web Sites and Search Engines (1998) and awarded Google the Technical Excellence Award, for Innovation in Web Application Development in 1999. </span>

	<span id="sent52">In 2000, Google earned a Webby Award, a People's Voice Award for technical achievement, and in 2001, was awarded Outstanding Search Service, Best Image Search Engine, Best Design, Most Webmaster Friendly Search Engine, and Best Search Feature at the Search Engine Watch Awards.``<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent53">In 2004, Page and Brin were named ``Persons of the Week'' by ABC World News Tonight. </span>

	<span id="sent54">Page received an honorary doctorate from the University of Michigan in 2009 during graduation commencement ceremonies.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent55">In 2011, he was ranked 24th on the Forbes list of the world's billionaires and as the 11th richest person in the United States.
