<div>

	<span id="sent0">The Spanish Civil War was a major conflict that devastated Spain from 17 July 1936 to 1 April 1939. </span>

	<span id="sent1">It began after an attempted coup d'etat by a group of Spanish Army generals against the government of the Second Spanish Republic, then under the leadership of president Manuel Azana. </span>

	<span id="sent2">The nationalist coup was supported by the conservative Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (Confederacion Espanola de Derechas Autonomas, or C.E.D.A), monarchists known as Carlist groups, and the Fascist Falange (Falange Espanola de las J.O.N.S.). </span>

	<span id="sent3">Following the partially successful coup, Spain was left divided as supporters of the existing Republican government fought the forces of the new Nationalist government for control of the country. </span>

	<span id="sent4">The war ended with the victory of the Nationalists, the overthrow of the Republican government, and the founding of an authoritarian state led by General Francisco Franco. </span>

	<span id="sent5">In the aftermath of the civil war, all right-wing parties were fused into the state party of the Franco regime.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent6">The Nationalists (nacionales) received the support of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, as well as neighbouring Portugal. </span>

	<span id="sent7">The Communist Soviet Union intervened on the Republican side, although it encouraged factional conflict to the benefit of the Soviet foreign policy, and its actions may have been detrimental to the Republican war effort as a whole. </span>

	<span id="sent8">The United States government offered no official support for either side, although over two thousand Americans volunteered on the Republican side. </span>

	<span id="sent9">Meanwhile, American corporations such as Texaco, General Motors, Ford Motors, and The Firestone Tire and Rubber Company greatly assisted the Nationalist army, furnishing a regular supply of trucks, tires, machine tools, and fuel.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent10">The new tank warfare tactics and the terror bombing of cities from the air were features of the Spanish Civil War which played a significant part in the later general European war.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent11">The Spanish Civil War has been dubbed ``the first media war'', with several writers and journalists covering it wanting their work ``to support the cause''. </span>

	<span id="sent12">Foreign correspondents and writers covering it included Ernest Hemingway, Georges Bernanos, Martha Gellhorn, Cesar Vallejo, George Orwell, Arthur Koestler, Halfdan Rasmussen and Robert Capa. </span>

	<span id="sent13">Like most international observers, they tended to support the Republicans, with some such as Orwell participating directly in the fighting.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent14">Like most civil wars, it became notable for the passion and political division it inspired, and for atrocities committed on both sides of the conflict. </span>

	<span id="sent15">The Spanish Civil War often pitted family members, neighbors, and friends against each other. </span>

	<span id="sent16">Apart from the combatants, many civilians were killed for their political or religious views by both sides, and after the war ended in 1939, the losing Republicans were persecuted by the victorious Nationalists.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent17">An estimated total of more than 300,000 people lost their lives as a consequence of the war. </span>

	<span id="sent18">Out of them probably more than 120,000 were civilians executed by either side.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent19">Prelude to war.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent20">Historical context.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent21">There were several reasons for the war, many of them long-term tensions that had escalated over the years.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent22">The 19th century was turbulent for Spain. </span>

	<span id="sent23">The country had undergone several civil wars and revolts, carried out by both reformists and the conservatives, who tried to displace each other from power. </span>

	<span id="sent24">A liberal tradition that first ascended to power with the Spanish Constitution of 1812 sought to abolish the monarchy of the old regime and to establish a liberal state. </span>

	<span id="sent25">The most traditionalist sectors of the political sphere systematically tried to avert these reforms and to sustain the monarchy. </span>

	<span id="sent26">The Carlists -supporters of Infante Carlos and his descendants -rallied to the cry of ``God, Country and King'' and fought for the cause of Spanish tradition ( monarchy and Catholicism) against the liberalism  - and later, the republicanism  - of the Spanish governments of the day. </span>

	<span id="sent27">The Carlists, at times (including the Carlist Wars), allied with nationalists (not to be confused with the nationalists of the Civil War) attempting to restore the historic liberties (and broad regional autonomy) granted by the fueros (regional charters) of the Basque Country and Catalonia. </span>

	<span id="sent28">Further, from the mid-19th century onwards, liberalism was outflanked on its left by socialism of various types and especially by anarchism, which was far stronger in Spain than anywhere else in Europe.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent29">Spain experienced a number of different systems of rule in the period between the Napoleonic wars of the early 19th century and the outbreak of the Civil War. </span>

	<span id="sent30">During most of the 19th century, Spain was a constitutional monarchy, but under attack from various directions. </span>

	<span id="sent31">The First Spanish Republic, founded in 1873, was short-lived. </span>

	<span id="sent32">A monarchy under Alfonso XIII lasted from 1887 to 1931, but from 1923 was held in place by the military dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera. </span>

	<span id="sent33">Following Primo de Rivera's overthrow in 1930, the monarchy was unable to maintain power and the Second Spanish Republic was declared in 1931. </span>

	<span id="sent34">This Republic soon came to be led by a coalition of the left and center. </span>

	<span id="sent35">A number of controversial reforms were passed, such as the Agrarian Law of 1932, distributing land among poor peasants. </span>

	<span id="sent36">Millions of Spaniards had been living in poverty under the firm control of the aristocratic landowners in a quasi-feudal system. </span>

	<span id="sent37">These reforms created strong opposition from the landowners and the aristocrats. </span>

	<span id="sent38">At the same time, the anticlericalist acts of the government infuriated the clergymen, while military cutbacks and reforms further alienated the military.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent39">Constitution of 1931 and reform programme.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent40">On 14 April 1931 the Second Republic was declared in Spain. </span>

	<span id="sent41">Centuries of monarchical tradition -interrupted only by the brief interlude of 1873-74 -were abandoned. </span>

	<span id="sent42">King Alfonso XIII left the country following local and municipal elections in which Republican candidates won the majority of votes in urban areas. </span>

	<span id="sent43">The departure led to a provisional government under Niceto Alcala Zamora, a Catholic and a landowner from Cordoba, and a constituent Cortes drew up a new constitution, which was adopted on 9 December 1931, after being passed by a referendum three days earlier. </span>

	<span id="sent44">The Spanish Constitution of 1931 meant the legal beginning of the Second Spanish Republic, in which the election of both the positions of Head of State and Head of government was meant to be democratic.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent45">The 1931 Constitution was formally effective from 1931 until 1939; however, in the spring of 1936, at the onset of the Spanish Civil War, it was largely abandoned by the Republicans in favor of leftist revolution.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent46">Spain entered the twentieth century a dominantly agrarian nation  - a nation which, moreover, had lost its colonies. </span>

	<span id="sent47">It was marked by uneven social and cultural development between town and country, between regions, within classes. </span>

	<span id="sent48">'Spain was not one country but a number of countries and regions marked by their uneven historical development.' </span>

	<span id="sent49">From the turn of the century, however, there had been a significant advance in industrial development. </span>

	<span id="sent50">Between 1910 and 1930 the industrial working class more than doubled to over 2,500,000. </span>

	<span id="sent51">Those engaged in agriculture fell from 66 per cent to 45 per cent in the same period. </span>

	<span id="sent52">The coalition hoped to concentrate its major reforms on three sectors: the 'latifundist aristocracy', the church and the army  - though the attempt would come at a moment of world economic crisis. </span>

	<span id="sent53">In the south less than 2 per cent of all landowners had over two thirds of the land, while 750,000 labourers eked out a living on near starvation wages. </span>

	<span id="sent54">The country was 'prone to centrifugal tendencies', for example there was a tension between Catalan and Basque nationalist sentiment away from an agrarian and centralist ruling class in Madrid. </span>

	<span id="sent55">While the coalition held political power, economic power escaped it. </span>

	<span id="sent56">In historian Hugh Thomas's words, 'Like so many others before and since it frightened the middle class without satisfying the workers.' </span>

	<span id="sent57">It adopted the measures of separation of church and state, genuine universal suffrage, a cabinet responsible to a single chamber parliament, a secular educational system. </span>

	<span id="sent58">This last measure antagonised the Church. </span>

	<span id="sent59">Pius XI's 1929 encyclical Divini illius magistri had said that the Church 'directly and perpetually' possessed 'the whole truth' in the moral sphere. </span>

	<span id="sent60">Education was, therefore, 'first and super-eminently' the function of the Church. </span>

	<span id="sent61">Primo de Rivera's dictatorship had offered the Church the protection it felt was its due. </span>

	<span id="sent62">Now however, an areligious republic excluded the Church from education (prohibited teaching by religious orders, even in private schools), restricted Church property rights and investments, provided for confiscation of and prohibitions on ownership of Church property, and banned the Society of Jesus. </span>

	<span id="sent63">The 1931 revolution that established the Second Republic brought to power an anticlerical government.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent64">The government was unable to control the anti-Catholic sentiment and deadly mob attacks on churches and monasteries. </span>

	<span id="sent65">Catholics mustered their forces in opposition, exacerbating the conditions that led to the war. </span>

	<span id="sent66">As early as October 1931 Gil Robles the leading spokesman of the parliamentary right argued that the constitution was 'born dead' -a 'dictatorial Constitution in the name of democracy.' </span>

	<span id="sent67">Robles wanted to use mass meetings `` to give supporters of the right a sense of their own strength and, ominously, to accustom them 'to fight, when necessary, for the possession of the street.' </span>

	<span id="sent68">``<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent69">On 3 June 1933, in the encyclical Dilectissima Nobis (On Oppression Of The Church Of Spain), Pope Pius XI condemned the Spanish Government's deprivation of the civil liberties on which the Republic was supposedly based, noting in particular the expropriation of Church property and schools and the persecution of religious communities and orders.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent70">Commentators have posited that the ``hostile'' approach to the issues of church and state was a substantial cause of the breakdown of democracy and the onset of civil war. </span>

	<span id="sent71">Since the far left considered moderation of the anticlerical aspects of the constitution as totally unacceptable, commentators have argued that ``the Republic as a democratic constitutional regime was doomed from the outset''.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent72">1933 election and aftermath.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent73">In the 1933 elections to the Cortes Generales, the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (Confederacion Espanola de Derechas Autonomas or CEDA) won a plurality of seats; however, these were not enough to form a majority. </span>

	<span id="sent74">Despite the results, then President Niceto Alcala-Zamora declined to invite the leader of the CEDA to form a government and instead invited the Radical Republican Party and its leader Alejandro Lerroux to do so. </span>

	<span id="sent75">CEDA supported the Lerroux government; it later demanded and, on 1 October 1934, received three ministerial positions.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent76">Lerroux's alliance with the right, his suppression of the revolt in 1934, and the Stra-Perlo scandal combined to leave him and his party with little support going into the 1936 election; Lerroux lost his seat in parliament.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent77">Rising tensions and political violence.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent78">Hostility between the left and the right increased after the 1933 formation of the Government. </span>

	<span id="sent79">Spain experienced general strikes and street conflicts. </span>

	<span id="sent80">Noted among the strikes was the miners' revolt in northern Spain and riots in Madrid. </span>

	<span id="sent81">Nearly all rebellions were crushed by the Government and political arrests followed.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent82">Tensions rose in the period before the start of the war. </span>

	<span id="sent83">Radicals became more aggressive, and conservatives turned to paramilitary and vigilante actions. </span>

	<span id="sent84">According to official sources, 330 people were assassinated and 1,511 were wounded in political violence; records show 213 failed assassination attempts, 113 general strikes, and the destruction (typically by arson) of 160 religious buildings.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent85">1936 Popular Front victory and aftermath.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent86">In the 1936 Elections a new coalition of Socialists ( Spanish Worker Socialist Party, PSOE), liberals (Republican Left and the Republican Union Party), Communists, and various regional nationalist groups won the extremely tight election. </span>

	<span id="sent87">The results gave 34 percent of the popular vote to the Popular Front and 33 percent to the incumbent government of the CEDA. </span>

	<span id="sent88">This result, when coupled with the Socialists' refusal to participate in the new government, led to a general fear of revolution.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent89">Azana becomes president.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent90">Without the Socialists, Prime Minister Manuel Azana, a liberal who favored gradual reform while respecting the democratic process, led a minority government. </span>

	<span id="sent91">In April, parliament replaced President Niceto Alcala-Zamora with Azana. </span>

	<span id="sent92">The removal of Zamora was made on specious grounds using a constitutional technicality. </span>

	<span id="sent93">Although the right also voted for Zamora's removal, this was a watershed event which inspired many conservatives to give up on parliamentary politics. </span>

	<span id="sent94">Azana had found that by spring of 1936 the left was using its influence to circumvent the Republic and the constitution and was adamant about increasingly radical changes. </span>

	<span id="sent95">Leon Trotsky wrote that Zamora had been Spain's ``stable pole'', and his removal made the climate revolutionary.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent96">Azana was the object of intense hatred by Spanish rightists because he had pushed a reform agenda through a recalcitrant parliament in 1931 -1933. </span>

	<span id="sent97">Joaquin Arraras, a friend of Francisco Franco, called him ``a repulsive caterpillar of red Spain.'' </span>

	<span id="sent98">The Spanish generals particularly disliked Azana because he had cut the army's budget and closed the military academy while war minister (1931). </span>

	<span id="sent99">CEDA turned its campaign chest over to army plotter Emilio Mola. </span>

	<span id="sent100">Monarchist Jose Calvo Sotelo replaced CEDA's Gil Robles as the right's leading spokesman in parliament.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent101">Murder of Calvo Sotelo.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent102">Jose Calvo Sotelo was the leading Spanish monarchist and a prominent parliamentary conservative. </span>

	<span id="sent103">He protested against what he viewed as escalating anti-religious terror, expropriations, and hasty agricultural reforms, which he considered Bolshevist and anarchist. </span>

	<span id="sent104">He instead advocated the creation of a corporative state.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent105">On 12 July 1936, in Madrid, a far right group murdered Lieutenant Jose Castillo of the Assault Guards (a special police corps created to deal with urban violence) and a Socialist. </span>

	<span id="sent106">The next day, Assault Guards with forged papers ``arrested'' Calvo Sotelo and abducted him in an Assault Guard van. </span>

	<span id="sent107">Leftist gunman Luis Cuenca, who was operating in a commando unit of the Assault Guard led by Captain Fernando Condes Romero, is said to have murdered Calvo Sotelo. </span>

	<span id="sent108">Condes was close to the Socialist leader Indalecio Prieto, and Cuenca was one of Prieto's bodyguards.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent109">The murder of such a prominent member of parliament, with involvement of the police, aroused suspicions and strong reactions among the Center and the Right. </span>

	<span id="sent110">Although the Nationalist generals, with a plane en route to take Francisco Franco to the Army of Africa, were already in advanced stages of a planned uprising, the event provided a catalyst and convenient public justification for their coup.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent111">Outbreak of the war.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent112">Nationalist military revolt.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent113">The monarchist General Jose Sanjurjo was the figurehead of the rebellion, while Emilio Mola was chief planner and second in command. </span>

	<span id="sent114">Mola began serious planning in the spring, but General Francisco Franco hesitated until early July, inspiring other plotters to refer to him as ``Miss Canary Islands 1936''. </span>

	<span id="sent115">Franco was a key player because of his prestige as a former director of the military academy and as the man who suppressed the Socialist uprising of 1934.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent116">Fearing a military coup, Prime Minister Casares Quiroga sent General Manuel Goded Llopis to the Balearic Islands and Franco to the Canary Islands. </span>

	<span id="sent117">On 17 July 1936, the plotters signaled the beginning of the coup by broadcasting the code phrase, ``Over all of Spain, the sky is clear.'' </span>

	<span id="sent118">Llopis and Franco immediately took control of the islands to which they were assigned. </span>

	<span id="sent119">Warned that a coup was imminent, leftists barricaded the roads on 17 July, but Franco avoided capture by taking a tugboat to the airport.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent120">Two British MI6 intelligence agents, Cecil Bebb and Major Hugh Pollard, then flew Franco to Spanish Morocco to see Juan March Ordinas, where the Spanish Army of Africa, led by Nationalist officers, was unopposed.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent121">Government reaction.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent122">The rising was intended to be a swift coup d'etat, but was botched in certain areas allowing the government to retain control of parts of the country. </span>

	<span id="sent123">At this first stage, the rebels failed to take any major cities -in Madrid they were hemmed into the Montana barracks. </span>

	<span id="sent124">The barracks fell the next day, with much bloodshed. </span>

	<span id="sent125">In Barcelona, anarchists armed themselves and defeated the rebels. </span>

	<span id="sent126">General Goded Llopis, who arrived from the Balearic islands, was captured and later executed. </span>

	<span id="sent127">However, the turmoil facilitated anarchist control over Barcelona and much of the surrounding Aragonese and Catalan countryside, effectively breaking away from the Republican government and establishing anarchism in Catalonia. </span>

	<span id="sent128">According to Noam Chomsky:<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent129">When the coup came, the Republican government was paralyzed. </span>

	<span id="sent130">Workers armed themselves in Madrid and Barcelona, robbing government armories and even ships in the harbor, and put down the insurrection while the government vacillated, torn between the twin dangers of submitting to Franco and arming the working classes. </span>

	<span id="sent131">In large areas of Spain effective authority passed into the hands of the anarchist and socialist workers who played a substantial, generally dominant role in putting down the insurrection.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent132">The Republicans held on to Valencia and controlled almost all of the Eastern Spanish coast and central area around Madrid. </span>

	<span id="sent133">Except for Asturias, Cantabria and part of the Basque Country, the Nationalists took most of northern and northwestern Spain and also a southern area in central and western Andalusia including Seville.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent134">Combatants.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent135">The war was cast by Republican sympathizers as a struggle between `` tyranny and democracy'', and by Nationalist supporters as between Communist and anarchist ``red hordes'' and ``Christian civilization''. </span>

	<span id="sent136">Nationalists also claimed to be protecting the establishment and bringing security and direction to an ungoverned and lawless society.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent137">The active participants in the war covered the entire gamut of the political positions of the time. </span>

	<span id="sent138">The Nationalist (nacionales) side included the Carlists and Legitimist monarchists, Spanish nationalists, the Falange, and most conservatives and monarchist liberals, Virtually all Nationalist groups had very strong Catholic convictions and supported the native Spanish clergy. </span>

	<span id="sent139">On the Republican side were Marxists, liberals, and anarchists.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent140">Spanish politics, especially on the left, were quite fragmented. </span>

	<span id="sent141">At the beginning, socialists and radicals supported democracy, while the communists and anarchists opposed the institution of the republic as much as the monarchists. </span>

	<span id="sent142">There were internal divisions even among the socialists: a group that adhered to classical Marxism, and a more progressive Marxist group. </span>

	<span id="sent143">The former was the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), one of whose delegates to the Soviet Union challenged Stalin regarding his use of the CHEKA to rein in dissidents, and upon his return to Spain convinced the PSOE to reject affiliation with the 5th to 7th Comintern. </span>

	<span id="sent144">From the Comintern's point of view the increasingly powerful, if fragmented, left and the weak right were an optimum situation. </span>

	<span id="sent145">Their goal was to use a veil of legitimate democratic institutions to outlaw the right, converting the state into the Soviet vision of a ``people's republic'' with total leftist domination, a goal repeatedly voiced in Comintern instructions and in the public statements of the PCE (Communist Party of Spain). </span>

	<span id="sent146">The left and Basque or Catalan nationalist conservatives had many conflicting ideas. </span>

	<span id="sent147">The Cortes (Spanish Parliament) consisted of 16 parties in 1931. </span>

	<span id="sent148">An attempt by the communists to seize control resisted by anarchists resulted in the massacre of hundreds of rebels and civil war between communists and anarchists in Catalonia.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent149">The actions of the Republican government slowly coagulated the different people on the right.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent150">The Nationals included the majority of the Catholic clergy and of practicing Catholics (outside of the Basque region), important elements of the army, most of the large landowners, and many businessmen. </span>

	<span id="sent151">The Republicans included most urban workers, most peasants, and much of the educated middle class, especially those who were not entrepreneurs.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent152">Republicans.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent153">Republicans (also known as Spanish loyalists) received weapons and volunteers from the Soviet Union, Mexico, the international Marxists movement and the International Brigades. </span>

	<span id="sent154">The Republicans ranged from centrists who supported a moderately capitalist liberal democracy to revolutionary anarchists; their power base was primarily secular and urban, but also included landless peasants, and it was particularly strong in industrial regions like Asturias and Catalonia. </span>

	<span id="sent155">This faction was called variously the ``loyalists'' by its supporters; the ``Republicans'', ``the Popular Front'' or ``the Government'' by all parties; and ``the reds'' by its enemies. </span>

	<span id="sent156">Regarding the term ``loyalist'', Historian Stanley Payne notes: ``the adjective ''loyalist`` is somewhat misleading, for there was no attempt to remain loyal to the constitutional Republican regime. </span>

	<span id="sent157">If that had been the scrupulous policy of the left, there would have been no revolt and civil war in the first place.``<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent158">The conservative, strongly Catholic Basque country, along with Galicia and the more left-leaning Catalonia, sought autonomy or even independence from the central government of Madrid. </span>

	<span id="sent159">This option was left open by the Republican government. </span>

	<span id="sent160">All these forces were gathered under the People's Republican Army (Ejercito Popular Republicano, or EPR).<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent161">Nationalists.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent162">The Nationalists (also called ``insurgents'', ``rebels'' or by opponents ``Francoists'' or overinclusively as ``Fascists'') fearing national fragmentation, opposed the separatist movements, and were chiefly defined by their anti-communism, which galvanized diverse or opposed movements like falangists or monarchists. </span>

	<span id="sent163">Their leaders had a generally wealthier, more conservative, monarchist, landowning background, and (with the exception of the Carlists) favoured the centralization of state power.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent164">One of the Nationalists' principal stated motives was to confront the anti-clericalism of the Republican regime and to defend the Church, which had been the target of attacks, and which many on the Republican side blamed for the ills of the country. </span>

	<span id="sent165">Even before the war, in the Asturias uprising of 1934 religious buildings were burnt and at least 100 clergy, religious, and police were killed, but the president and the radicals prevented the implementation of any serious sanctions against the revolutionaries. </span>

	<span id="sent166">According to Payne:<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent167">More than 1,000 were killed, the majority revolutionaries, and there were atrocities on both sides. </span>

	<span id="sent168">The revolutionaries shot nearly 100 people in cold blood, most of them policemen and priests, and an almost equal number of rebels -possibly even more -were executed out of hand by the troops that suppressed the revolt.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent169">Articles 24 and 26 of the Constitution of the Republic had banned the Jesuits, which deeply offended many within the conservatives. </span>

	<span id="sent170">The revolution in the republican zone at the outset of the war, killing 7,000 clergy and thousands of lay people, drove many Catholics, left then with little alternative, to the Nationalists.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent171">Other factions.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent172">Catalan and Basque nationalists were not univocal. </span>

	<span id="sent173">Left-wing Catalan nationalists were on the Republican side. </span>

	<span id="sent174">Conservative Catalan nationalists were far less vocal supporting the Republican government due to the anti-clericalism and confiscations occurring in some areas controlled by the latter (some conservative Catalan nationalists like Francesc Cambo actually funded the Nationalist side). </span>

	<span id="sent175">Basque nationalists, heralded by the conservative Basque nationalist party, were mildly supportive of the Republican government, even though Basque nationalists in Alava and Navarre sided with the uprising for the same reasons influencing Catalan conservative nationalists. </span>

	<span id="sent176">Notwithstanding the religious matters, the Basque nationalists, who nearly all sided with the Republic, were, for the most part, practicing Catholics.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent177">Foreign involvement.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent178">The Spanish Civil War had large numbers of non-Spanish citizens participating in combat and advisory positions. </span>

	<span id="sent179">Foreign governments contributed large amounts of financial assistance and military aid to forces led by Franco. </span>

	<span id="sent180">Forces fighting on behalf of the Republicans also received limited aid, but support was seriously hampered by the arms embargo declared by France and the UK. </span>

	<span id="sent181">These embargoes were never very effective however, and France especially was accused of allowing large shipments through to the Republicans (but the accusations often came from Italy, itself heavily involved for the Nationalists). </span>

	<span id="sent182">The clandestine actions of the various European powers were at the time considered to be risking another ' Great War'.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent183">The League of Nations' reaction to the war was mostly neutral and insufficient to contain the massive importation of arms and other war resources by the fighting factions. </span>

	<span id="sent184">Although a Non-Intervention Committee was created, its policies were largely ineffective. </span>

	<span id="sent185">Its directives were dismantled due to the policies of appeasement of both European democratic and non-democratic powers of the late 1930s: the official Spanish government of Juan Negrin was gradually abandoned within the organization during this period.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent186">Support for Nationalists.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent187">Despite the Irish government's prohibition against participating in the war, around 700 Irishmen, followers of Eoin O'Duffy known as the ``Irish Brigade'', went to Spain to fight on Franco's side. </span>

	<span id="sent188">The Nationalists received weapons and logistical support from Portugal. </span>

	<span id="sent189">In addition approximately 8,000 Portuguese volunteers, known as Viriatos after an aborted national legion that failed to get off the ground in the early months of the war, fought in Franco's forces. </span>

	<span id="sent190">Romanian volunteers were led by Ion I Mota, deputy-leader of the Legion of the Archangel Michael (or Iron Guard), whose group of seven Legionaries visited Spain in December 1936 to ally their movement to the Nationalists. </span>

	<span id="sent191">Mota was killed in action at Majadahonda on January 13, 1937.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent192">Germany.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent193">Francisco Franco asked Adolf Hitler from Nazi Germany and Benito Mussolini from Fascist Italy to aid the Nationalists. </span>

	<span id="sent194">Hitler agreed and ordered three major military operations in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. </span>

	<span id="sent195">He authorized Operation Feuerzauber (``Fire Magic'') in late July 1936. </span>

	<span id="sent196">He mobilized 20 three-motor Junkers Ju 52 planes with six escort fighters, 85 Germans on the SS Usaramo ship to work on the planes, and transferred German troops stationed in Morocco to Spain. </span>

	<span id="sent197">A few months later in late September, Hitler again mobilized men and materials to aid Franco for Operation Otto. </span>

	<span id="sent198">He sent 24 more Panzer I light tanks, a flak, and some radio equipment. </span>

	<span id="sent199">German commander Major Alexander von Scheele also converted the Junkers 52s to bombers. </span>

	<span id="sent200">By October, there were an estimated 600 -800 German soldiers in Spain. </span>

	<span id="sent201">Hitler's largest and last move was the Condor Legion (Legion Condor). </span>

	<span id="sent202">Initiated in November 1936, he sent an additional 3,500 troops into combat and supplied the Spanish Nationalists with 92 new planes. </span>

	<span id="sent203">Hitler kept the Condor Legion in Spain until the end of the war in May 1939. </span>

	<span id="sent204">At its zenith, The German force numbered about 12,000 men, and as many as 19,000 Germans fought in Spain. </span>

	<span id="sent205">In total Nazi Germany provided Nationalists with 600 planes, 200 tanks, and 1,000 artillery pieces.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent206">Italy.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent207">After Franco's request and in response to Adolf Hitler's encouragement, Benito Mussolini joined the war, partly because he did not want to be outdone by Hitler. </span>

	<span id="sent208">While Mussolini sent more ground troops than Hitler, he initially supplied fewer materials. </span>

	<span id="sent209">At the beginning of war in September 1936, Mussolini had only supplied 68 aircraft and several hundred small arms to the Nationalists. </span>

	<span id="sent210">However, the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina Italiana) played a major role in the Mediterranean blockade and ultimately Italy supplied machine guns, artillery, aircraft, tankettes, the ``Legionary Air Force'' (Aviazione Legionaria), and the ``Corps of Volunteer Troops'' (Corpo Truppe Volontarie, or CTV). </span>

	<span id="sent211">The Italian CTV reached a high of about 50,000 men and, by rotation, more than 75,000 Italians were to fight for the Nationalists in Spain. </span>

	<span id="sent212">In total fascist Italy provided Nationalists with 660 planes, 150 tanks and 1,000 artillery pieces.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent213">Portugal.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent214">Salazar's Estado Novo played a most important role in supplying Franco's forces with ammunition and many other logistical resources. </span>

	<span id="sent215">Despite its discreet direct military involvement  - restrained to a somewhat ``semi-official'' endorsement, by its authoritarian regime, of an 8,000 -12,000-strong volunteer force, the so-called `` Viriatos''  - for the whole duration of the conflict, Portugal was instrumental in providing the Nationalists with a vital logistical organization and by reassuring Franco and his allies that no interference whatsoever would hinder the supply traffic directed to the Nationalists, crossing the borders of the two Iberian countries  - the Nationalists used to refer to Lisbon as ``the port of Castile''.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent216">Support for Republicans.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent217">International Brigades.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent218">Many non-Spanish people, often affiliated with radical, communist or socialist parties or groups, joined the International Brigades, believing that the Spanish Republic was the front line of the war against fascism. </span>

	<span id="sent219">The troops of the International Brigades represented the largest foreign contingent of those fighting for the Republicans. </span>

	<span id="sent220">Roughly 30,000 foreign nationals from up to 53 nations fought in the brigades. </span>

	<span id="sent221">Most of them were communists or trade unionists, and while organised by communists guided or controlled by Moscow, they were almost all individual volunteers.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent222">Likely more than 1,000 volunteers came from each of France, Italy, Germany, Poland, USSR, USA, UK, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Ireland, Yugoslavia, Hungary and Canada . </span>

	<span id="sent223">The Thalmann Battalion was a group of German, Swiss, Austrian and Scandinavian volunteers who distinguished themselves during the Siege of Madrid. </span>

	<span id="sent224">The American volunteers fought in units such as the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and Canadians in the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent225">Over five hundred Romanians fought on the Republican side, including Romanian Communist Party members Petre Borila and Valter Roman.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent226">Some Chinese joined the international brigades. </span>

	<span id="sent227">At the end of the war, the majority returned to China, while some went to prison, others went to refugee camps in southern France, and a handful remained in Spain, including about ten who married Spanish women.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent228">Soviet Union.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent229">The Soviet Union primarily provided material assistance to the Republican forces. </span>

	<span id="sent230">In total the USSR provided Spain with 806 planes, 362 tanks, and 1,555 artillery pieces. </span>

	<span id="sent231">The Soviet Union ignored the League of Nations embargo and sold arms to the Republic when few other nations would do so; thus it was the Republic's only important source of major weapons. </span>

	<span id="sent232">Stalin had signed the Non-Intervention Agreement but decided to break the pact. </span>

	<span id="sent233">However, unlike Hitler and Mussolini who openly violated the pact, Stalin tried to do so secretly. </span>

	<span id="sent234">He created a section X of the Soviet Union military to head the operation, coined Operation X. However, while a new branch of the military was created especially for Spain, most of the weapons and artillery sent to Spain were antiques. </span>

	<span id="sent235">Stalin did not want the arms to be traceable to the Soviet Union, so most were taken from museums from around the country. </span>

	<span id="sent236">He also used weapons captured from past conflicts. </span>

	<span id="sent237">However, modern weapons such as BT-5 tanks and I-16 fighter aircraft were also supplied to Spain.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent238">Many of the Soviet's deliveries were lost or smaller than Stalin had ordered. </span>

	<span id="sent239">He only gave short notice, which meant many weapons were lost in the delivery process. </span>

	<span id="sent240">Lastly, when the ships did leave with supplies for the Republicans, the journey was extremely slow. </span>

	<span id="sent241">Stalin ordered the builders to include false decks in the original design of the boat. </span>

	<span id="sent242">Then, once the ship left shore it was required to change its flag and change the color of parts of the ship to minimize capture by the Nationalists. </span>

	<span id="sent243">However in 1938, Stalin withdrew his troops and tanks as government ranks floundered.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent244">The Republic had to pay for Soviet arms with the official gold reserves of the Bank of Spain, in an affair that would become a frequent subject of Francoist propaganda afterward (see Moscow Gold). </span>

	<span id="sent245">The cost to the Republic of Soviet arms was more than US $500 million, two-thirds of the gold reserves that Spain had at the beginning of the war.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent246">The Soviet Union also sent a number of military advisers to Spain (2,000 -3,000 ). </span>

	<span id="sent247">While Soviet troops amounted to no more than 700 men, Soviet ``volunteers'' often operated Soviet-made Republican tanks and aircraft. </span>

	<span id="sent248">In addition, the Soviet Union directed Communist parties around the world to organize and recruit the International Brigades.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent249">Another significant Soviet involvement was the pervasive activities of the NKVD all along the Republican rearguard. </span>

	<span id="sent250">Communist figures like Vittorio Vidali (``Comandante Contreras''), Iosif Grigulevich and, above all, Alexander Orlov led those not-so-secret operations, that included murders like those of Andreu Nin and Jose Robles.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent251">Mexico.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent252">Unlike the United States and major Latin American governments such as those of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru, the Mexican government supported the Republicans. </span>

	<span id="sent253">Mexico refused to follow the French-British non-intervention proposals. </span>

	<span id="sent254">Mexico furnished $2,000,000 in aid and provided some material assistance, which included 20,000 rifles, 28 million cartridges, 8 artillery pieces and small number of American-made aircraft such as the Bellanca CH-300 and Spartan Zeus that served in the Mexican Air Force.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent255">However, Mexico's most important contributions to the Spanish Republic were diplomatic and to provide sanctuary for Republican refugees including many Spanish intellectuals and orphaned children from Republican families.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent256">Chronology.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent257">1936.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent258">Coup leader Sanjurjo was killed in a plane crash on 20 July, leaving an effective command split between Mola in the North and Franco in the South. </span>

	<span id="sent259">On 21 July, the fifth day of the rebellion, the Nationalists captured the main Spanish naval base at Ferrol in northwestern Spain. </span>

	<span id="sent260">A rebel force under Colonel Beorlegui Canet, sent by General Emilio Mola, undertook the Campaign of Guipuzcoa from July to September. </span>

	<span id="sent261">The capture of Guipuzcoa isolated the Republican provinces in the north. </span>

	<span id="sent262">On 5 September, after heavy fighting the force took Irun, closing the French border to the Republicans. </span>

	<span id="sent263">On 13 September, the Basques surrendered San Sebastian to the Nationalists, who then advanced toward their capital, Bilbao. </span>

	<span id="sent264">The Republican militias on the border of Vizcaya halted these forces at the end of September.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent265">Franco was chosen overall Nationalist commander at a meeting of ranking generals at Salamanca on 21 September. </span>

	<span id="sent266">Franco won another victory on 27 September when they relieved the Alcazar at Toledo. </span>

	<span id="sent267">A Nationalist garrison under Colonel Moscardo had held the Alcazar in the center of the city since the beginning of the rebellion, resisting thousands of Republican troops who completely surrounded the isolated building. </span>

	<span id="sent268">The Republic's inability to take the Alcazar was a serious blow to its prestige in view of its overwhelming numerical superiority in the area. </span>

	<span id="sent269">Two days after relieving the siege, Franco proclaimed himself Generalisimo and Caudillo (``chieftain''), while forcibly unifying the various and diverse Falangist, Royalist and other elements within the Nationalist cause.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent270">In October, the Francoist troops launched a major offensive toward Madrid, reaching it in early November and launching a major assault on the city on 8 November. </span>

	<span id="sent271">The Republican government was forced to shift from Madrid to Valencia, out of the combat zone, on 6 November. </span>

	<span id="sent272">However, the Nationalists' attack on the capital was repulsed in fierce fighting between 8 November and 23 November. </span>

	<span id="sent273">A contributory factor in the successful Republican defense was the arrival of the International Brigades, though only around 3,000 of them participated in the battle. </span>

	<span id="sent274">Having failed to take the capital, Franco bombarded it from the air and, in the following two years, mounted several offensives to try to encircle Madrid.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent275">1937.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent276">With his ranks swelled by Italian troops and Spanish colonial soldiers from Morocco, Franco made another attempt to capture Madrid in January and February 1937, but again failed.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent277">On 21 February the League of Nations Non-Intervention Committee ban on foreign national `` volunteers'' went into effect. </span>

	<span id="sent278">The large city of Malaga was taken on 8 February. </span>

	<span id="sent279">On 7 March, the German Condor Legion equipped with Heinkel He 51 biplanes arrived in Spain; on 26 April the Legion bombed the town of Guernica, killing hundreds. </span>

	<span id="sent280">Two days later, Franco's army overran the town.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent281">After the fall of Guernica, the Republican government began to fight back with increasing effectiveness. </span>

	<span id="sent282">In July, they made a move to recapture Segovia, forcing Franco to pull troops away from the Madrid front to halt their advance. </span>

	<span id="sent283">Mola, Franco's second-in-command, was killed on 3 June, and in early July, despite the fall of Bilbao in June, the government launched a strong counter-offensive in the Madrid area, which the Nationalists repulsed with difficulty. </span>

	<span id="sent284">The clash was called `` Battle of Brunete'' after a town in the province of Madrid.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent285">Franco invaded Aragon in August and then took the city of Santander. </span>

	<span id="sent286">With the surrender of the Republican army in the Basque territory and after two months of bitter fighting in Asturias (Gijon finally fell in late October) Franco had effectively won in the north. </span>

	<span id="sent287">At the end of November, with Franco's troops closing in on Valencia, the government had to move again, this time to Barcelona.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent288">1938.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent289">The Battle of Teruel was an important confrontation. </span>

	<span id="sent290">The city belonged to the Nationalists at the beginning of the battle, but the Republicans conquered it in January. </span>

	<span id="sent291">The Francoist troops launched an offensive and recovered the city by 22 February, but in order to do so Franco relied heavily on German and Italian air support and repaid them with extensive mining rights.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent292">On 7 March, the Nationalists launched the Aragon Offensive. </span>

	<span id="sent293">By 14 April, they had pushed through to the Mediterranean, cutting the Republican-held portion of Spain in two. </span>

	<span id="sent294">The Republican government tried to sue for peace in May, but Franco demanded unconditional surrender; the war raged on. </span>

	<span id="sent295">In July, the Nationalist army pressed southward from Teruel and south along the coast toward the capital of the Republic at Valencia but was halted in heavy fighting along the XYZ Line, a system of fortifications defending Valencia.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent296">The Republican government then launched an all-out campaign to reconnect their territory in the Battle of the Ebro, from 24 July until 26 November. </span>

	<span id="sent297">The campaign was unsuccessful, and was undermined by the Franco-British appeasement of Hitler in Munich with the concession of Czechoslovakia. </span>

	<span id="sent298">This effectively destroyed Republican morale by ending hope of an anti-fascist alliance with the Western powers. </span>

	<span id="sent299">The retreat from the Ebro all but determined the final outcome of the war. </span>

	<span id="sent300">Eight days before the new year, Franco threw massive forces into an invasion of Catalonia.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent301">1939.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent302">Franco's troops conquered Catalonia in a whirlwind campaign during the first two months of 1939. </span>

	<span id="sent303">Tarragona fell on 14 January, followed by Barcelona on 26 January and Girona on 5 February. </span>

	<span id="sent304">Five days after the fall of Girona, the last resistance in Catalonia was broken.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent305">On 27 February, the United Kingdom and France recognized the Franco regime.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent306">Only Madrid and a few other strongholds remained for the Republican forces. </span>

	<span id="sent307">Then, on 28 March, with the help of pro-Franco forces inside the city, Madrid fell to the Nationalists. </span>

	<span id="sent308">The next day, Valencia, which had held out under their guns for close to two years, also surrendered. </span>

	<span id="sent309">Franco proclaimed victory in a radio speech aired on 1 April, when the last of the Republican forces surrendered.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent310">After the end of the War, there were harsh reprisals against Franco's former enemies; thousands of Republicans were imprisoned and at least 30,000 executed. </span>

	<span id="sent311">Other calculations of these deaths range from 50,000 to 200,000. </span>

	<span id="sent312">Many others were put to forced labour, building railways, drying out swamps, digging canals, etc.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent313">Hundreds of thousands of Republicans fled abroad, some 500,000 to France. </span>

	<span id="sent314">Refugees were confined in internment camps of the French Third Republic, such as Camp Gurs or Camp Vernet, where 12,000 Republicans were housed in squalid conditions. </span>

	<span id="sent315">Of the 17,000 refugees housed in Gurs, the farmers and ordinary people who could not find relations in France were encouraged by the Third Republic, in agreement with the Francoist government, to return to Spain. </span>

	<span id="sent316">The great majority did so and were turned over to the Francoist authorities in Irun. </span>

	<span id="sent317">From there they were transferred to the Miranda de Ebro camp for ``purification'' according to the Law of Political Responsibilities. </span>

	<span id="sent318">After the proclamation by Marshal Philippe Petain of the Vichy regime, the refugees became political prisoners, and the French police attempted to round up those who had been liberated from the camp. </span>

	<span id="sent319">Along with other ``undesirables'', they were sent to the Drancy internment camp before being deported to Nazi Germany. </span>

	<span id="sent320">About 5,000 Spaniards thus died in Mauthausen concentration camp.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent321">After the official end of the war, guerrilla war was waged on an irregular basis well into the 1950s, being gradually reduced by military defeats and scant support from the exhausted population. </span>

	<span id="sent322">In 1944, a group of republican veterans, who also fought in the French resistance against the Nazis, invaded the Val d'Aran in northwest Catalonia, but were defeated after ten days.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent323">Evacuation of children.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent324">As war proceeded in the Northern front, the Republican authorities arranged the evacuation of children. </span>

	<span id="sent325">These Spanish War children were shipped to Britain, Belgium, the Soviet Union, other European countries and Mexico. </span>

	<span id="sent326">Those in Western European countries returned to their families after the war, but many of those in the Soviet Union, from Communist families, remained and experienced the Second World War and its effects on the Soviet Union.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent327">The Nationalist side also arranged evacuations of children, women and elderly from war zones. </span>

	<span id="sent328">Refugee camps for those civilians evacuated by the Nationalists were set up in Portugal, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent329">Atrocities.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent330">At least 500,000 people were executed during the war. </span>

	<span id="sent331">In his updated history of the Spanish Civil War, Antony Beevor writes, ``Franco's ensuing ' white terror' claimed 200,000 lives. </span>

	<span id="sent332">The ' red terror' had already killed 38,000.`` </span>

	<span id="sent333">Julius Ruiz concludes that ``although the figures remain disputed, a minimum of 37,843 executions were carried out in the Republican zone with a maximum of 150,000 executions (including 50,000 after the war) in Nationalist Spain.'' </span>

	<span id="sent334">Cesar Vidal puts the number of Republican victims at 110,965. </span>

	<span id="sent335">In 2008 a Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, opened an investigation into the executions and disappearances of 114,266 people between 17 July 1936 and December 1951 (he has since been indicted for violating a 1977 amnesty by these actions). </span>

	<span id="sent336">Among the executions investigated was that of the poet and dramatist Federico Garcia Lorca.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent337">In the early days of the war, executions of people who were caught on the ``wrong'' side of the lines became widespread in conquered areas. </span>

	<span id="sent338">The outbreak of the war provided an excuse for settling accounts and resolving longstanding feuds. </span>

	<span id="sent339">In these paseos (``strolls''), as the executions were called, the victims were taken from their refuges or jails to be shot outside of town. </span>

	<span id="sent340">The corpses were abandoned or interred in graves dug by the victims themselves. </span>

	<span id="sent341">Local police just noted the appearance of the corpses.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent342">Nationalists.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent343">The atrocities of the Nationalists, frequently ordered by authorities in order to eradicate any trace of leftism in Spain, were common. </span>

	<span id="sent344">According to historian Paul Preston, the minimum number of those executed by the rebels is 130,000, and is likely to be far higher. </span>

	<span id="sent345">The violence carried out in the rebel zone was carried out by the military, the ``Civil Guard'', the Falange in the name of the regime and legitimized by the Catholic Church.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent346">Many such acts were committed by reactionary groups during the first weeks of the war. </span>

	<span id="sent347">This included the execution of school teachers (because the efforts of the Second Spanish Republic to promote laicism and to displace the Church from the education system by closing religious schools were considered by the Nationalists as an attack on the Roman Catholic Church); the massive killings of civilians in the cities they captured; the execution of unwanted individuals (including non-combatants such as trade-unionists and known Republican sympathisers etc).<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent348">Nationalist forces committed massacres in Seville, where some 10,000 people were shot. </span>

	<span id="sent349">In Granada, about 8000 people were murdered. </span>

	<span id="sent350">After the capture of Almendralejo, about 1000 prisoners were shot, including 100 women. </span>

	<span id="sent351">Some 2000 were shot when Badajoz was conquered by Yague. </span>

	<span id="sent352">In February 1937, over 4000 were killed after the capture of Malaga. </span>

	<span id="sent353">When Bilbao was conquered, some 1000 people were executed. </span>

	<span id="sent354">The numbers of people killed as the African columns raped, looted, and murdered their way through Seville and Madrid are particularly difficult to calculate.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent355">Nationalists murdered Catholic clerics. </span>

	<span id="sent356">In one particular incident, following the capture of Bilbao, hundreds of people, including 16 priests who had served as chaplains for the Republican forces, were taken to the countryside or to graveyards to be murdered.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent357">Franco's forces persecuted Protestants. </span>

	<span id="sent358">They murdered Protestant ministers. </span>

	<span id="sent359">Franco's forces were determined to remove from Spain the ``Protestant heresy''. </span>

	<span id="sent360">Pastor Miguel Blanco of Seville was shot as was Pastor Jose Garcia Fernandez of Granada. </span>

	<span id="sent361">In Zaragoza, on August 18, the church was attacked by Franco's forces. </span>

	<span id="sent362">They destroyed furniture, burned Bibles and books and stole valuables. </span>

	<span id="sent363">Many Protestants were imprisoned and tortured.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent364">The Nationalists also persecuted the Basque people. </span>

	<span id="sent365">They were determined to eradicate Basque culture. </span>

	<span id="sent366">According to Basque sources, some 22,000 Basques were murdered by Nationalists immediately after the Civil War.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent367">The Nationalist side also conducted aerial bombing of cities in Republican territory, carried out mainly by the Luftwaffe volunteers of the Condor Legion and the Italian air force volunteers of the Corpo Truppe Volontarie (Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Guernica, and other cities). </span>

	<span id="sent368">The most notorious example of this tactic of terror bombings was the Bombing of Guernica.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent369">Republicans.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent370">An estimated 55,000 civilians died in Republican-held territories. </span>

	<span id="sent371">The Republican government was anticlerical and supporters attacked and murdered Roman Catholic clergy in reaction to news of the military revolt. </span>

	<span id="sent372">In Republican held territories, Roman Catholic churches, convents, monasteries, and cemeteries were desecrated. </span>

	<span id="sent373">Through the war, nearly all segments of the Republicans, Basques being a notable exception, took part in semi-organized anti-Roman Catholic, anticlerical killing of 6,832 members of the Catholic clergy and religious orders. </span>

	<span id="sent374">By the end of the war 20 percent of the nation's clergy had been killed.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent375">As well as clergy, civilians were executed in Republican areas. </span>

	<span id="sent376">Some civilians were executed as suspected fifth columnists. </span>

	<span id="sent377">Others died in revenge due to news of the massacres carried out in the Nationalist zone. </span>

	<span id="sent378">Air raids committed against Republican cities were another factor. </span>

	<span id="sent379">Historian Paul Preston emphasizes that Republican authorities did not order such measures to be taken. </span>

	<span id="sent380">As pressure mounted with increasing success of the Nationalists, many civilians were executed by councils and tribunals controlled by competing Communist and Anarchist groups. </span>

	<span id="sent381">Many anarchists were executed by Soviet-advised communist functionaries in Catalonia as described by George Orwell's description of the purges in Barcelona in 1937 in Homage to Catalonia.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent382">Republicans initially reacted to the attempted coup by arresting and executing actual and perceived Nationalists. </span>

	<span id="sent383">In the Andalusian town of Ronda, 512 alleged Nationalists were executed in the first month of the war.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent384">Communist Santiago Carrillo Solares has been accused of the killing of Nationalists in the Paracuellos massacre near Paracuellos del Jarama and Torrejon de Ardoz. </span>

	<span id="sent385">However, the extent to which (in particular) Carrillo was responsible remains a source of debate. </span>

	<span id="sent386">Communists committed numerous atrocities against fellow Republicans: Andre Marty, known as the Butcher of Albacete, was responsible for the deaths of some 500 members of the International Brigades, and Andreu Nin, leader of the POUM, and many prominent POUM members were murdered by the Communists.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent387">Social revolution.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent388">In the anarchist-controlled areas, Aragon and Catalonia, in addition to the temporary military success, there was a vast social revolution in which the workers and peasants collectivised land and industry, and set up councils parallel to the paralyzed Republican government. </span>

	<span id="sent389">This revolution was opposed by both the Soviet-supported communists, who ultimately took their orders from Stalin's politburo (which feared a loss of control), and the Social Democratic Republicans (who worried about the loss of civil property rights). </span>

	<span id="sent390">The agrarian collectives had considerable success despite opposition and lack of resources.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent391">As the war progressed, the government and the communists were able to leverage their access to Soviet arms to restore government control over the war effort, through both diplomacy and force. </span>

	<span id="sent392">Anarchists and the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (Partido Obrero de Unificacion Marxista, or POUM) were integrated into the regular army, albeit with resistance; the POUM was outlawed and falsely denounced as an instrument of the fascists. </span>

	<span id="sent393">In the May Days of 1937, many hundreds or thousands of anti-fascist soldiers fought for control of strategic points in Barcelona.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent394">The pre-war Falange was a small party of some 30 -40,000 members. </span>

	<span id="sent395">It also called for a social revolution that would have seen Spanish society transformed by National Syndicalism. </span>

	<span id="sent396">Following the execution of its leader, Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera, by the Republicans, the party swelled in size to over 400,000. </span>

	<span id="sent397">The leadership of the Falange suffered 60% casualties in the early days of the civil war and the party was transformed by new members and rising new leaders, called camisas nuevas (``new shirts''), who were less interested in the revolutionary aspects of National Syndicalism. </span>

	<span id="sent398">Subsequently, Franco united all rightist parties into the ironically named Falange Espanola Tradicionalista de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista (FET y de las JONS), or the Traditionalist Spanish Falange of the Unions of the National-Syndicalist Offensive.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent399">The 1930s also saw Spain become a focus for pacifist organizations including the Fellowship of Reconciliation, the War Resisters League and the War Resisters' International. </span>

	<span id="sent400">Many people including, as they are now called, the 'insumisos' ('defiant ones', conscientious objectors) argued and worked for non-violent strategies. </span>

	<span id="sent401">Prominent Spanish pacifists such as Amparo Poch y Gascon and Jose Brocca supported the Republicans. </span>

	<span id="sent402">Brocca argued that Spanish pacifists had no alternative but to make a stand against fascism. </span>

	<span id="sent403">He put this stand into practice by various means including organizing agricultural workers to maintain food supplies and through humanitarian work with war refugees.
