	<span id="sent0">World War I was a military conflict centered on Europe that began in the summer of 1914. </span>

	<span id="sent1">The fighting ended in late 1918 in western Europe and by 1922 in eastern Europe. </span>

	<span id="sent2">This conflict involved most of the world's great powers, assembled in two opposing alliances: the Allies (centred around the Triple Entente) and the Central Powers. </span>

	<span id="sent3">More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilized in one of the largest wars in history. </span>

	<span id="sent4">More than 15 million people were killed, making it one of the deadliest conflicts in history. </span>

	<span id="sent5">The war is also known as the First World War, the Great War, the World War (prior to the outbreak of World War II), and the War to End All Wars.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent6">The assassination on June 28, 1914 of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, is seen as the immediate trigger of the war, though long-term causes, such as imperialistic foreign policy, played a major role. </span>

	<span id="sent7">Ferdinand's assassination at the hands of Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip resulted in Habsburg ultimatum against the Kingdom of Serbia. </span>

	<span id="sent8">Several alliances that had been formed over the past decades were invoked, so within weeks the major powers were at war; with all having colonies, the conflict soon spread around the world.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent9">The conflict opened with the German invasion of Belgium, Luxembourg and France; the Austro-Hungarian invasion of Serbia and a Russian attack against Prussia. </span>

	<span id="sent10">After the German march on Paris was brought to a halt, the Western Front settled into a static battle of attrition with a trench line that changed little until 1917. </span>

	<span id="sent11">In the East, the Russian army successfully fought against the Austro-Hungarian forces but were forced back by the German army. </span>

	<span id="sent12">Additional fronts opened with the Ottoman Empire joining the war in 1914, Italy and Bulgaria in 1915 and Romania in 1916. </span>

	<span id="sent13">Imperial Russia left the war in 1917. </span>

	<span id="sent14">After a 1918 German offensive along the western front, American forces entered the trenches and the German armies were driven back in a series of successful allied offensives. </span>

	<span id="sent15">Germany surrendered on Armistice Day, November 11, 1918.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent16">By the war's end, four major imperial powers -the German, Russian, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires -had been militarily and politically defeated, with the last two ceasing to exist. </span>

	<span id="sent17">The revolutionized Soviet Union emerged from the Russian Empire, while the map of central Europe was completely redrawn into numerous smaller states. </span>

	<span id="sent18">The League of Nations was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict. </span>

	<span id="sent19">The European nationalism spawned by the war, the repercussions of Germany's defeat, and of the Treaty of Versailles would eventually lead to the beginning of World War II in 1939.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent20">Background.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent21">In the 19th century, the major European powers had gone to great lengths to maintain a balance of power throughout Europe, resulting by 1900 in a complex network of political and military alliances throughout the continent. </span>

	<span id="sent22">These had started in 1815, with the Holy Alliance between Prussia, Russia, and Austria. </span>

	<span id="sent23">Then, in October 1873, German Chancellor Bismarck negotiated the League of the Three Emperors (German: Dreikaiserbund) between the monarchs of Austria -Hungary, Russia and Germany. </span>

	<span id="sent24">This agreement failed because Austria -Hungary and Russia could not agree over Balkan policy, leaving Germany and Austria -Hungary in an alliance formed in 1879, called the Dual Alliance. </span>

	<span id="sent25">This was seen as a method of countering Russian influence in the Balkans as the Ottoman Empire continued to weaken. </span>

	<span id="sent26">In 1882, this alliance was expanded to include Italy in what became the Triple Alliance.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent27">After 1870, European conflict was averted largely due to a carefully planned network of treaties between the German Empire and the remainder of Europe orchestrated by Chancellor Bismarck. </span>

	<span id="sent28">He especially worked to hold Russia at Germany's side to avoid a two-front war with France and Russia. </span>

	<span id="sent29">With the ascension of Wilhelm II as German Emperor ( Kaiser), Bismarck's system of alliances was gradually de-emphasized. </span>

	<span id="sent30">For example, the Kaiser refused to renew the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia in 1890. </span>

	<span id="sent31">Two years later the Franco-Russian Alliance was signed to counteract the force of the Triple Alliance. </span>

	<span id="sent32">In 1904, the United Kingdom sealed an alliance with France, the Entente cordiale and in 1907, the United Kingdom and Russia signed the Anglo-Russian Convention. </span>

	<span id="sent33">This system of interlocking bilateral agreements formed the Triple Entente.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent34">German industrial and economic power had grown greatly after unification and the foundation of the empire in 1870. </span>

	<span id="sent35">From the mid-1890s on, the government of Wilhelm II used this base to devote significant economic resources to building up the Imperial German Navy (German: Kaiserliche Marine), established by Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, in rivalry with the British Royal Navy for world naval supremacy. </span>

	<span id="sent36">As a result, both nations strove to out-build each other in terms of capital ships. </span>

	<span id="sent37">With the launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1906, the British Empire expanded on its significant advantage over its German rivals. </span>

	<span id="sent38">The arms race between Britain and Germany eventually extended to the rest of Europe, with all the major powers devoting their industrial base to the production of the equipment and weapons necessary for a pan-European conflict. </span>

	<span id="sent39">Between 1908 and 1913, the military spending of the European powers increased by 50%.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent40">Austria-Hungary precipitated the Bosnian crisis of 1908 -1909 by officially annexing the former Ottoman territory of Bosnia Herzegovina, which it had occupied since 1878. </span>

	<span id="sent41">This greatly angered the Pan-Slavic and thus pro-Serbian Romanov Dynasty who ruled Russia and the Kingdom of Serbia, because Bosnia Herzegovina contained a significant Slavic Serbian population. </span>

	<span id="sent42">Russian political maneuvering in the region destabilized peace accords that were already fracturing in what was known as ``the Powder keg of Europe''.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent43">In 1912, the First Balkan War was fought between the Balkan League and the fracturing Ottoman Empire. </span>

	<span id="sent44">The resulting Treaty of London further shrank the Ottoman Empire, creating an independent Albanian State while enlarging the territorial holdings of Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Greece. </span>

	<span id="sent45">When Bulgaria attacked both Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913 it lost most of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece and Southern Dobruja to Romania in the 33 day Second Balkan War, further destabilising the region.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent46">On 28 June 1914, Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian-Serb student and member of Young Bosnia, assassinated the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo, Bosnia. </span>

	<span id="sent47">This began a period of diplomatic manoeuvring between Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France and Britain called the July Crisis. </span>

	<span id="sent48">Wanting to end Serbian interference in Bosnia conclusively, Austria-Hungary delivered the July Ultimatum to Serbia, a series of ten demands which were deliberately unacceptable, made with the intention of deliberately initiating a war with Serbia. </span>

	<span id="sent49">When Serbia acceded to only eight of the ten demands levied against it in the ultimatum, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July 1914. </span>

	<span id="sent50">Strachan argues ``Whether an equivocal and early response by Serbia would have made any difference to Austria-Hungary's behaviour must be doubtful. </span>

	<span id="sent51">Franz Ferdinand was not the sort of personality who commanded popularity, and his demise did not cast the empire into deepest mourning``.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent52">The Russian Empire, unwilling to allow Austria -Hungary to eliminate its influence in the Balkans, and in support of its long time Serb proteges, ordered a partial mobilization one day later. </span>

	<span id="sent53">When the German Empire began to mobilize on 30 July 1914, France, sporting significant animosity over the German conquest of Alsace-Lorraine during the Franco-Prussian War, ordered French mobilization on 1 August. </span>

	<span id="sent54">Germany declared war on Russia on the same day. </span>

	<span id="sent55">The United Kingdom declared war on Germany, on 3 August 1914, following an 'unsatisfactory reply' to the British ultimatum that Belgium must be kept neutral.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent56">Chronology.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent57">Opening hostilities.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent58">Confusion among the Central Powers.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent59">The strategy of the Central Powers suffered from miscommunication. </span>

	<span id="sent60">Germany had promised to support Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia, but interpretations of what this meant differed. </span>

	<span id="sent61">Previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914, but never tested in exercises. </span>

	<span id="sent62">Austro-Hungarian leaders believed Germany would cover its northern flank against Russia. </span>

	<span id="sent63">Germany, however, envisioned Austria-Hungary directing the majority of its troops against Russia, while Germany dealt with France. </span>

	<span id="sent64">This confusion forced the Austro-Hungarian Army to divide its forces between the Russian and Serbian fronts.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent65">On 9 September 1914, the Septemberprogramm, a plan which detailed Germany's specific war aims and the conditions that Germany sought to force upon the Allied Powers, was outlined by German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent66">African campaigns.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent67">Some of the first clashes of the war involved British, French and German colonial forces in Africa. </span>

	<span id="sent68">On 7 August, French and British troops invaded the German protectorate of Togoland. </span>

	<span id="sent69">On 10 August German forces in South-West Africa attacked South Africa; sporadic and fierce fighting continued for the remainder of the war. </span>

	<span id="sent70">The German colonial forces in German East Africa, led by Colonel Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck, fought a guerilla warfare campaign for the duration of World War I, surrendering only two weeks after the armistice took effect in Europe.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent71">Serbian campaign.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent72">The Serbian army fought the Battle of Cer against the invading Austro-Hungarians, beginning on 12 August, occupying defensive positions on the south side of the Drina and Sava rivers. </span>

	<span id="sent73">Over the next two weeks Austrian attacks were thrown back with heavy losses, which marked the first major Allied victory of the war and dashed Austro-Hungarian hopes of a swift victory. </span>

	<span id="sent74">As a result, Austria had to keep sizeable forces on the Serbian front, weakening its efforts against Russia.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent75">German forces in Belgium and France.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent76">At the outbreak of the First World War, the German army (consisting in the West of seven field armies) executed a modified version of the Schlieffen Plan, designed to quickly attack France through neutral Belgium before turning southwards to encircle the French army on the German border. </span>

	<span id="sent77">The plan called for the right flank of the German advance to converge on Paris and initially, the Germans were very successful, particularly in the Battle of the Frontiers (14 -24 August). </span>

	<span id="sent78">By 12 September, the French with assistance from the British forces halted the German advance east of Paris at the First Battle of the Marne (5 -12 September). </span>

	<span id="sent79">The last days of this battle signified the end of mobile warfare in the west. </span>

	<span id="sent80">The French offensive into Germany launched on August 7 with the Battle of Mulhouse had limited success.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent81">In the east, only one Field Army defended East Prussia and when Russia attacked in this region it diverted German forces intended for the Western Front. </span>

	<span id="sent82">Germany defeated Russia in a series of battles collectively known as the First Battle of Tannenberg (17 August  - 2 September), but this diversion exacerbated problems of insufficient speed of advance from rail-heads not foreseen by the German General Staff. </span>

	<span id="sent83">The Central Powers were thereby denied a quick victory and forced to fight a war on two fronts. </span>

	<span id="sent84">The German army had fought its way into a good defensive position inside France and had permanently incapacitated 230,000 more French and British troops than it had lost itself. </span>

	<span id="sent85">Despite this, communications problems and questionable command decisions cost Germany the chance of obtaining an early victory.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent86">Asia and the Pacific.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent87">New Zealand occupied German Samoa (later Western Samoa) on 30 August. </span>

	<span id="sent88">On 11 September, the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force landed on the island of Neu Pommern (later New Britain), which formed part of German New Guinea. </span>

	<span id="sent89">Japan seized Germany's Micronesian colonies and, after the Battle of Tsingtao, the German coaling port of Qingdao in the Chinese Shandong peninsula. </span>

	<span id="sent90">Within a few months, the Allied forces had seized all the German territories in the Pacific; only isolated commerce raiders and a few holdouts in New Guinea remained.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent91">Early stages.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent92">Trench warfare begins.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent93">Military tactics before World War I had failed to keep pace with advances in technology. </span>

	<span id="sent94">These changes resulted in the building of impressive defence systems, which out of date tactics could not break through for most of the war. </span>

	<span id="sent95">Barbed wire was a significant hindrance to massed infantry advances. </span>

	<span id="sent96">Artillery, vastly more lethal than in the 1870s, coupled with machine guns, made crossing open ground very difficult. </span>

	<span id="sent97">The Germans introduced poison gas; it soon became used by both sides, though it never proved decisive in winning a battle. </span>

	<span id="sent98">Its effects were brutal, causing slow and painful death, and poison gas became one of the most-feared and best-remembered horrors of the war. </span>

	<span id="sent99">Commanders on both sides failed to develop tactics for breaching entrenched positions without heavy casualties. </span>

	<span id="sent100">In time, however, technology began to produce new offensive weapons, such as the tank. </span>

	<span id="sent101">Britain and France were its primary users; the Germans employed captured Allied tanks and small numbers of their own design.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent102">After the First Battle of the Marne, both Entente and German forces began a series of outflanking manoeuvres, in the so-called `` Race to the Sea''. </span>

	<span id="sent103">Britain and France soon found themselves facing entrenched German forces from Lorraine to Belgium's Flemish coast. </span>

	<span id="sent104">Britain and France sought to take the offensive, while Germany defended the occupied territories; consequently, German trenches were generally much better constructed than those of their enemy. </span>

	<span id="sent105">Anglo-French trenches were only intended to be ``temporary'' before their forces broke through German defences. </span>

	<span id="sent106">Both sides attempted to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances. </span>

	<span id="sent107">On 22 April 1915 at the Second Battle of Ypres, the Germans (in violation of the Hague Convention) used chlorine gas for the first time on the Western Front. </span>

	<span id="sent108">Algerian troops retreated when gassed and a six kilometre (four mile) hole opened in the Allied lines that the Germans quickly exploited, taking Kitcheners' Wood. </span>

	<span id="sent109">Canadian soldiers closed the breach at the Second Battle of Ypres. </span>

	<span id="sent110">At the Third Battle of Ypres, Canadian and ANZAC troops took the village of Passchendaele.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent111">On 1 July 1916, the British Army endured the bloodiest day in its history, suffering 57,470 casualties including 19,240 dead on the first day of the Battle of the Somme. </span>

	<span id="sent112">Most of the casualties occurred in the first hour of the attack. </span>

	<span id="sent113">The entire Somme offensive cost the British Army almost half a million men.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent114">Neither side proved able to deliver a decisive blow for the next two years, though protracted German action at Verdun throughout 1916, combined with the bloodletting at the Somme, brought the exhausted French army to the brink of collapse. </span>

	<span id="sent115">Futile attempts at frontal assault came at a high price for both the British and the French poilu (infantry) and led to widespread mutinies, especially during the Nivelle Offensive.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent116">Throughout 1915 -17, the British Empire and France suffered more casualties than Germany, due both to the strategic and tactical stances chosen by the sides. </span>

	<span id="sent117">At the strategic level, while the Germans only mounted a single main offensive at Verdun, the Allies made several attempts to break through German lines. </span>

	<span id="sent118">At the tactical level, Ludendorff's doctrine of `` elastic defence'' was well suited for trench warfare. </span>

	<span id="sent119">This defence had a relatively lightly defended forward position and a more powerful main position farther back beyond artillery range, from which an immediate and powerful counter-offensive could be launched.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent120">Ludendorff wrote on the fighting in 1917,<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent121">On the battle of the Menin Road Ridge Ludendorff wrote,<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent122">Around 1.1 to 1.2 million soldiers from the British and Dominion armies were on the Western Front at any one time. </span>

	<span id="sent123">A thousand battalions, occupying sectors of the line from the North Sea to the Orne River, operated on a month-long four-stage rotation system, unless an offensive was underway. </span>

	<span id="sent124">The front contained over 9,600 kilometres (5,965 mi) of trenches. </span>

	<span id="sent125">Each battalion held its sector for about a week before moving back to support lines and then further back to the reserve lines before a week out-of-line, often in the Poperinge or Amiens areas.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent126">In the 1917 Battle of Arras the only significant British military success was the capture of Vimy Ridge by the Canadian Corps under Sir Arthur Currie and Julian Byng. </span>

	<span id="sent127">The assaulting troops were able for the first time to overrun, rapidly reinforce and hold the ridge defending the coal-rich Douai plain.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent128">Naval war.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent129">At the start of the war, the German Empire had cruisers scattered across the globe, some of which were subsequently used to attack Allied merchant shipping. </span>

	<span id="sent130">The British Royal Navy systematically hunted them down, though not without some embarrassment from its inability to protect Allied shipping. </span>

	<span id="sent131">For example, the German detached light cruiser SMS Emden, part of the East-Asia squadron stationed at Tsingtao, seized or destroyed 15 merchantmen, as well as sinking a Russian cruiser and a French destroyer. </span>

	<span id="sent132">However, the bulk of the German East-Asia squadron -consisting of the armoured cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, light cruisers Nurnberg and Leipzig and two transport ships -did not have orders to raid shipping and was instead underway to Germany when it encountered elements of the British fleet. </span>

	<span id="sent133">The German flotilla, along with Dresden, sank two armoured cruisers at the Battle of Coronel, but was almost destroyed at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914, with only Dresden and a few auxiliaries escaping, but at the Battle of Mas a Tierra these too were destroyed or interned.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent134">Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany. </span>

	<span id="sent135">The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries. </span>

	<span id="sent136">Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to even neutral ships. </span>

	<span id="sent137">Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent138">The 1916 Battle of Jutland (German: Skagerrakschlacht, or ``Battle of the Skagerrak'') developed into the largest naval battle of the war, the only full-scale clash of battleships during the war. </span>

	<span id="sent139">It took place on 31 May  - 1 June 1916, in the North Sea off Jutland. </span>

	<span id="sent140">The Kaiserliche Marine's High Seas Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, squared off against the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet, led by Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. </span>

	<span id="sent141">The engagement was a stand off, as the Germans, outmanoeuvred by the larger British fleet, managed to escape and inflicted more damage to the British fleet than they received. </span>

	<span id="sent142">Strategically, however, the British asserted their control of the sea, and the bulk of the German surface fleet remained confined to port for the duration of the war.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent143">German U-boats attempted to cut the supply lines between North America and Britain. </span>

	<span id="sent144">The nature of submarine warfare meant that attacks often came without warning, giving the crews of the merchant ships little hope of survival. </span>

	<span id="sent145">The United States launched a protest, and Germany modified its rules of engagement. </span>

	<span id="sent146">After the notorious sinking of the passenger ship RMS Lusitania in 1915, Germany promised not to target passenger liners, while Britain armed its merchant ships, placing them beyond the protection of the ``cruiser rules'' which demanded warning and placing crews in ``a place of safety'' (a standard which lifeboats did not meet). </span>

	<span id="sent147">Finally, in early 1917 Germany adopted a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, realizing the Americans would eventually enter the war. </span>

	<span id="sent148">Germany sought to strangle Allied sea lanes before the U.S. could transport a large army overseas, but were only able to maintain five long range U-boats on station, to limited effect.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent149">The U-boat threat lessened in 1917, when merchant ships entered convoys escorted by destroyers. </span>

	<span id="sent150">This tactic made it difficult for U-boats to find targets, which significantly lessened losses; after the introduction of hydrophone and depth charges, accompanying destroyers might attack a submerged submarine with some hope of success. </span>

	<span id="sent151">The convoy system slowed the flow of supplies, since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled. </span>

	<span id="sent152">The solution to the delays was an extensive program to build new freighters. </span>

	<span id="sent153">Troop ships were too fast for the submarines and did not travel the North Atlantic in convoys. </span>

	<span id="sent154">The U-boats had sunk almost 5,000 Allied ships, at a cost of 178 submarines.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent155">World War I also saw the first use of aircraft carriers in combat, with HMS Furious launching Sopwith Camels in a successful raid against the Zeppelin hangars at Tondern in July 1918, as well as blimps for antisubmarine patrol.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent156">Southern theatres.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent157">War in the Balkans.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent158">Faced with Russia, Austria-Hungary could spare only one-third of its army to attack Serbia. </span>

	<span id="sent159">After suffering heavy losses, the Austrians briefly occupied the Serbian capital, Belgrade. </span>

	<span id="sent160">A Serbian counter attack in the battle of Kolubara, however, succeeded in driving them from the country by the end of 1914. </span>

	<span id="sent161">For the first ten months of 1915, Austria-Hungary used most of its military reserves to fight Italy. </span>

	<span id="sent162">German and Austro-Hungarian diplomats, however, scored a coup by persuading Bulgaria to join in attacking Serbia. </span>

	<span id="sent163">The AustroHungarian provinces of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia provided troops for Austria-Hungary, invading Serbia as well as fighting Russia and Italy. </span>

	<span id="sent164">Montenegro allied itself with Serbia.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent165">Serbia was conquered in a little more than a month. </span>

	<span id="sent166">The attack began in October, when the Central Powers launched an offensive from the north; four days later the Bulgarians joined the attack from the east. </span>

	<span id="sent167">The Serbian army, fighting on two fronts and facing certain defeat, retreated into Albania, halting only once to make a stand against the Bulgarians. </span>

	<span id="sent168">The Serbs suffered defeat near modern day Gnjilane in the Battle of Kosovo. </span>

	<span id="sent169">Montenegro covered the Serbian retreat toward the Adriatic coast in the Battle of Mojkovac in 6 -7 January 1916, but ultimately the Austrians conquered Montenegro, too. </span>

	<span id="sent170">Serbian forces were evacuated by ship to Greece.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent171">In late 1915, a Franco-British force landed at Salonica in Greece, to offer assistance and to pressure the government to declare war against the Central Powers. </span>

	<span id="sent172">Unfortunately for the Allies, the pro-German King Constantine I dismissed the pro-Allied government of Eleftherios Venizelos, before the Allied expeditionary force could arrive.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent173">After conquest, Serbia was divided between Austro-Hungary and Bulgaria. </span>

	<span id="sent174">Bulgarians commenced bulgarization of the Serbian population in their occupation zone, banishing Serbian Cyrillic and the Serbian Orthodox Church. </span>

	<span id="sent175">After forced conscription of the Serbian population into the Bulgarian army in 1917, the Toplica Uprising began. </span>

	<span id="sent176">Serbian rebels liberated for a short time the area between the Kopaonik mountains and the South Morava river. </span>

	<span id="sent177">The uprising was crushed by joint efforts of Bulgarian and Austrian forces at the end of March 1917.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent178">The Macedonian Front proved static for the most part. </span>

	<span id="sent179">Serbian forces retook part of Macedonia by recapturing Bitola on 19 November 1916. </span>

	<span id="sent180">Only at the end of the conflict were the Entente powers able to break through, after most of the German and Austro-Hungarian troops had withdrawn. </span>

	<span id="sent181">The Bulgarians suffered their only defeat of the war at the Battle of Dobro Pole but days later, they decisively defeated British and Greek forces at the Battle of Doiran, avoiding occupation. </span>

	<span id="sent182">Bulgaria signed an armistice on 29 September 1918.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent183">Ottoman Empire.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent184">The Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers in the war, the secret Ottoman-German Alliance having been signed in August 1914. </span>

	<span id="sent185">It threatened Russia's Caucasian territories and Britain's communications with India via the Suez Canal. </span>

	<span id="sent186">The British and French opened overseas fronts with the Gallipoli (1915) and Mesopotamian campaigns. </span>

	<span id="sent187">In Gallipoli, Turkey successfully repelled the British, French and Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZACs). </span>

	<span id="sent188">In Mesopotamia, by contrast, after the disastrous Siege of Kut (1915 -16), British Imperial forces reorganized and captured Baghdad in March 1917. </span>

	<span id="sent189">Further to the west, in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, initial British setbacks were overcome when Jerusalem was captured in December 1917. </span>

	<span id="sent190">The Egyptian Expeditionary Force, under Field Marshal Edmund Allenby, broke the Ottoman forces at the Battle of Megiddo in September 1918.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent191">Russian armies generally had the best of it in the Caucasus. </span>

	<span id="sent192">Enver Pasha, supreme commander of the Turkish armed forces, was ambitious and dreamed of conquering central Asia. </span>

	<span id="sent193">He was, however, a poor commander. </span>

	<span id="sent194">He launched an offensive against the Russians in the Caucasus in December 1914 with 100,000 troops; insisting on a frontal attack against mountainous Russian positions in winter, he lost 86% of his force at the Battle of Sarikamish.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent195">The Russian commander from 1915 to 1916, General Yudenich, drove the Turks out of most of the southern Caucasus with a string of victories. </span>

	<span id="sent196">In 1917, Russian Grand Duke Nicholas assumed command of the Caucasus front. </span>

	<span id="sent197">Nicholas planned a railway from Russian Georgia to the conquered territories, so that fresh supplies could be brought up for a new offensive in 1917. </span>

	<span id="sent198">However, in March 1917, (February in the pre-revolutionary Russian calendar), the Czar was overthrown in the February Revolution and the Russian Caucasus Army began to fall apart. </span>

	<span id="sent199">In this situation, the army corps of Armenian volunteer units realigned themselves under the command of General Tovmas Nazarbekian, with Dro as a civilian commissioner of the Administration for Western Armenia. </span>

	<span id="sent200">The front line had three main divisions: Movses Silikyan, Andranik, and Mikhail Areshian. </span>

	<span id="sent201">Another regular unit was under Colonel Korganian. </span>

	<span id="sent202">There were Armenian partisan guerrilla detachments (more than 40,000 ) accompanying these main units.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent203">Instigated by the Arab bureau of the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Arab Revolt described in T. E. Lawrence's Seven Pillars of Wisdom was a major cause of the Ottoman Empire's defeat. </span>

	<span id="sent204">The revolts started with the Battle of Mecca by Sherif Hussein of Mecca with the help of Britain in June 1916, and ended with the Ottoman surrender of Damascus. </span>

	<span id="sent205">Fakhri Pasha the Ottoman commander of Medina showed stubborn resistance for over two and half years during the Siege of Medina.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent206">Along the border of Italian Libya and British Egypt, the Senussi tribe, incited and armed by the Turks, waged a small-scale guerilla war against Allied troops. </span>

	<span id="sent207">According to Martin Gilbert's The First World War, the British were forced to dispatch 12,000 troops to deal with the Senussi. </span>

	<span id="sent208">Their rebellion was finally crushed in mid-1916.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent209">Italian participation.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent210">Italy had been allied with the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires since 1882 as part of the Triple Alliance. </span>

	<span id="sent211">However, the nation had its own designs on Austrian territory in Trentino, Istria and Dalmatia. </span>

	<span id="sent212">Rome had a secret 1902 pact with France, effectively nullifying its alliance. </span>

	<span id="sent213">At the start of hostilities, Italy refused to commit troops, arguing that the Triple Alliance was defensive in nature, and that Austria -Hungary was an aggressor. </span>

	<span id="sent214">The Austro-Hungarian government began negotiations to secure Italian neutrality, offering the French colony of Tunisia in return. </span>

	<span id="sent215">The Allies made a counter-offer in which Italy would receive the Alpine province of South Tyrol and territory on the Dalmatian coast after the defeat of Austria-Hungary. </span>

	<span id="sent216">This was formalized by the Treaty of London. </span>

	<span id="sent217">Further encouraged by the Allied invasion of Turkey in April 1915, Italy joined the Triple Entente and declared war on Austria-Hungary on May 23. </span>

	<span id="sent218">Fifteen months later Italy declared war on Germany.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent219">Militarily, the Italians had numerical superiority. </span>

	<span id="sent220">This advantage, however, was lost, not only because of the difficult terrain in which fighting took place, but also because of the strategies and tactics employed. </span>

	<span id="sent221">Field Marshal Luigi Cadorna, a staunch proponent of the frontal assault, had dreams of breaking into the Slovenian plateau, taking Ljubljana and threatening Vienna. </span>

	<span id="sent222">It was a Napoleonic plan, which had no realistic chance of success in an age of barbed wire, machine guns, and indirect artillery fire, combined with hilly and mountainous terrain.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent223">On the Trentino front, the Austro-Hungarians took advantage of the mountainous terrain, which favoured the defender. </span>

	<span id="sent224">After an initial strategic retreat, the front remained largely unchanged, while Austrian Kaiserschutzen and Standschutzen engaged Italian Alpini in bitter hand-to-hand combat throughout the summer. </span>

	<span id="sent225">The Austro-Hungarians counter attacked in the Altopiano of Asiago, towards Verona and Padua, in the spring of 1916, ( Strafexpedition), but made little progress.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent226">Beginning in 1915, the Italians under Cadorna mounted eleven offensives on the Isonzo front along the Isonzo River, north east of Trieste. </span>

	<span id="sent227">All eleven offensives were repelled by the Austro-Hungarians, who held the higher ground. </span>

	<span id="sent228">In the summer of 1916, the Italians captured the town of Gorizia. </span>

	<span id="sent229">After this minor victory, the front remained static for over a year, despite several Italian offensives. </span>

	<span id="sent230">In the autumn of 1917, thanks to the improving situation on the Eastern front, the Austro-Hungarian troops received large numbers of reinforcements, including German Stormtroopers and the elite Alpenkorps. </span>

	<span id="sent231">The Central Powers launched a crushing offensive on 26 October 1917, spearheaded by the Germans. </span>

	<span id="sent232">They achieved a victory at Caporetto. </span>

	<span id="sent233">The Italian army was routed and retreated more than 100 kilometres (60 mi.) to reorganize, stabilising the front at the Piave River. </span>

	<span id="sent234">Since in the Battle of Caporetto Italian Army had heavy losses, the Italian Government called to arms the so called ' 99 Boys (Ragazzi del '99), that is, all males who were 18 years old. </span>

	<span id="sent235">In 1918, the Austro-Hungarians failed to break through, in a series of battles on the Asiago Plateau, finally being decisively defeated in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto in October of that year. </span>

	<span id="sent236">Austria-Hungary surrendered in early November 1918.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent237">Romanian participation.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent238">Romania had been allied with the Central Powers since 1882. </span>

	<span id="sent239">When the war began, however, it declared its neutrality, arguing that because Austria-Hungary had itself declared war on Serbia, Romania was under no obligation to join the war. </span>

	<span id="sent240">When the Entente Powers promised Romania large territories of eastern Hungary ( Transylvania and Banat) in exchange for Romania's declaring war on the Central Powers, the Romanian government renounced its neutrality, and on 27 August 1916 the Romanian army launched an attack against Austria-Hungary. </span>

	<span id="sent241">The Romanian offensive was initially successful, pushing back the Austro-Hungarian troops in Transylvania, but a counter attack by the forces of the Central Powers defeated the Romanian army and as a result of the Battle of Bucharest the Central Powers occupied Bucharest on 6 December 1916. </span>

	<span id="sent242">Fighting in Moldova continued in 1917 until an armistice was signed between the Central Powers and Romania on 9 December 1917.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent243">In January, 1918, Russia, allied to Romania, had to withdraw its troops from the Romanian front and Romanian forces established control over Bessarabia. </span>

	<span id="sent244">Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and the Bolshevik Russian government following talks between March 5 -9, 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on March 27, 1918 Romania attached Bessarabia to its territory, formally based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of the territory on the unification with Romania.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent245">Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers signing the Treaty of Bucharest on 7 May 1918. </span>

	<span id="sent246">Under that treaty Romania was obliged to cease war with the Central Powers. </span>

	<span id="sent247">Romania made small territorial concessions for Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the Carpathian mountains and granted oil concessions for Germany. </span>

	<span id="sent248">On the other hand, the Central Powers recognized the sovereignty of Romania over Bessarabia. </span>

	<span id="sent249">The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the Alexandru Marghiloman government and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918. </span>

	<span id="sent250">The next day, the Treaty of Bucharest was nullified by the terms of the Armistice of Compiegne. </span>

	<span id="sent251">Total Romanian deaths from 1914 to 1918, military and civilian, within contemporary borders, were estimated at 748,000.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent252">Fighting in India.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent253">The war began with an unprecedented outpouring of loyalty and goodwill towards the United Kingdom from within the mainstream political leadership, contrary to initial British fears of an Indian revolt. </span>

	<span id="sent254">The Indian Army in fact outnumbered the British Army at the beginning of the war. </span>

	<span id="sent255">India under British rule contributed greatly to the British war effort by providing men and resources. </span>

	<span id="sent256">This was done by the Indian Congress in hope of achieving self-government as India was very much under the control of the British. </span>

	<span id="sent257">The United Kingdom disappointed the Indians by not providing self-governance, leading to the Gandhian Era in Indian history. </span>

	<span id="sent258">About 1.3 million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, while both the Indian government and the princes sent large supplies of food, money, and ammunition. </span>

	<span id="sent259">In all 140,000 men served on the Western Front and nearly 700,000 in the Middle East. </span>

	<span id="sent260">Casualties of Indian soldiers totalled 47,746 killed and 65,126 wounded during World War I.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent261">Eastern Front.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent262">Initial actions.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent263">While the Western Front had reached stalemate, the war continued in East Europe. </span>

	<span id="sent264">Initial Russian plans called for simultaneous invasions of Austrian Galicia and German East Prussia. </span>

	<span id="sent265">Although Russia's initial advance into Galicia was largely successful, they were driven back from East Prussia by Hindenburg and Ludendorff at Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes in August and September 1914. </span>

	<span id="sent266">Russia's less developed industrial base and ineffective military leadership was instrumental in the events that unfolded. </span>

	<span id="sent267">By the spring of 1915, the Russians had retreated into Galicia, and in May the Central Powers achieved a remarkable breakthrough on Poland's southern frontiers. </span>

	<span id="sent268">On 5 August they captured Warsaw and forced the Russians to withdraw from Poland.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent269">Russian Revolution.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent270">Despite the success of the June 1916 Brusilov offensive in eastern Galicia, dissatisfaction with the Russian government's conduct of the war grew. </span>

	<span id="sent271">The success was undermined by the reluctance of other generals to commit their forces to support the victory. </span>

	<span id="sent272">Allied and Russian forces were revived only temporarily with Romania's entry into the war on 27 August. </span>

	<span id="sent273">German forces came to the aid of embattled Austro-Hungarian units in Transylvania and Bucharest fell to the Central Powers on 6 December. </span>

	<span id="sent274">Meanwhile, unrest grew in Russia, as the Tsar remained at the front. </span>

	<span id="sent275">Empress Alexandra's increasingly incompetent rule drew protests and resulted in the murder of her favourite, Rasputin, at the end of 1916.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent276">In March 1917, demonstrations in Petrograd culminated in the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II and the appointment of a weak Provisional Government which shared power with the Petrograd Soviet socialists. </span>

	<span id="sent277">This arrangement led to confusion and chaos both at the front and at home. </span>

	<span id="sent278">The army became increasingly ineffective.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent279">The war and the government became increasingly unpopular. </span>

	<span id="sent280">Discontent led to a rise in popularity of the Bolshevik party, led by Vladimir Lenin. </span>

	<span id="sent281">He promised to pull Russia out of the war and was able to gain power. </span>

	<span id="sent282">The triumph of the Bolsheviks in November was followed in December by an armistice and negotiations with Germany. </span>

	<span id="sent283">At first the Bolsheviks refused the German terms, but when Germany resumed the war and marched across Ukraine with impunity, the new government acceded to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on 3 March 1918. </span>

	<span id="sent284">It took Russia out of the war and ceded vast territories, including Finland, the Baltic provinces, parts of Poland and Ukraine to the Central Powers. </span>

	<span id="sent285">The manpower required for German occupation of former Russian territory may have contributed to the failure of the Spring Offensive, however, and secured relatively little food or other war materiel.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent286">With the adoption of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Entente no longer existed. </span>

	<span id="sent287">The Allied powers led a small-scale invasion of Russia, partly to stop Germany from exploiting Russian resources and, to a lesser extent, to support the Whites in the Russian Civil War. </span>

	<span id="sent288">Allied troops landed in Archangel and in Vladivostok.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent289">Wilhelm declares victory.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent290">In December 1916, after ten brutal months of the Battle of Verdun, the Germans attempted to negotiate a peace with the Allies, effectively declaring themselves the victors. </span>

	<span id="sent291">Soon after, U.S. President Wilson attempted to intervene as a peacemaker, asking in a note for both sides to state their demands. </span>

	<span id="sent292">Lloyd George's War Cabinet considered the German offer as a ploy to create divisions amongst the Allies and, after initial outrage and much deliberation, took Wilson's note as a separate effort, signalling that the U.S. was on the verge of entering the war against Germany following the ``submarine outrages''. </span>

	<span id="sent293">While the Allies debated a response to Wilson's offer the Germans chose to rebuff it in favour of ``a direct exchange of views''. </span>

	<span id="sent294">Learning of the German response, the Allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of 14 January. </span>

	<span id="sent295">They sought restoration of damages, the evacuation of occupied territories, reparations for France, Russia and Roumania, and a recognition of the principle of nationalities. </span>

	<span id="sent296">This included the liberation of Italians, Slavs, Roumanians, Czecho-Slovaks, and the creation of a ``free and united Poland''. </span>

	<span id="sent297">On the question of security, the Allies sought guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars, complete with sanctions, as a condition of any peace settlement.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent298">1917 -1918.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent299">Events of 1917 proved decisive in ending the war, although their effects were not fully felt until 1918. </span>

	<span id="sent300">The British naval blockade began to have a serious impact on Germany. </span>

	<span id="sent301">In response, in February 1917, the German General Staff convinced Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg to declare unrestricted submarine warfare, with the goal of starving Britain out of the war. </span>

	<span id="sent302">Tonnage sunk rose above 500,000 tons per month from February to July. </span>

	<span id="sent303">It peaked at 860,000 tons in April. </span>

	<span id="sent304">After July, the newly re-introduced convoy system became extremely effective in reducing the U-boat threat. </span>

	<span id="sent305">Britain was safe from starvation and German industrial output fell. </span>

	<span id="sent306">On 3 May 1917, during the Nivelle Offensive, the weary French 2nd Colonial Division, veterans of the Battle of Verdun, refused their orders, arriving drunk and without their weapons. </span>

	<span id="sent307">Their officers lacked the means to punish an entire division, and harsh measures were not immediately implemented. </span>

	<span id="sent308">Then, mutinies afflicted an additional 54 French divisions and saw 20,000 men desert. </span>

	<span id="sent309">The other Allied forces attacked but sustained tremendous casualties. </span>

	<span id="sent310">However, appeals to patriotism and duty, as well as mass arrests and trials, encouraged the soldiers to return to defend their trenches, although the French soldiers refused to participate in further offensive action. </span>

	<span id="sent311">Robert Nivelle was removed from command by 15 May, replaced by General Philippe Petain, who suspended bloody large-scale attacks.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent312">The victory of Austria -Hungary and Germany at the Battle of Caporetto led the Allies at the Rapallo Conference to form the Supreme War Council to coordinate planning. </span>

	<span id="sent313">Previously, British and French armies had operated under separate commands.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent314">In December, the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia. </span>

	<span id="sent315">This released troops for use in the west. </span>

	<span id="sent316">Ironically, German troop transfers could have been greater if their territorial acquisitions had not been so dramatic. </span>

	<span id="sent317">With German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the Western front. </span>

	<span id="sent318">The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for success based on a final quick offensive. </span>

	<span id="sent319">Furthermore, the leaders of the Central Powers and the Allies became increasingly fearful of social unrest and revolution in Europe. </span>

	<span id="sent320">Thus, both sides urgently sought a decisive victory.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent321">Entry of the United States.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent322">The United States originally pursued a policy of isolationism, avoiding conflict while trying to broker a peace. </span>

	<span id="sent323">Britain initially feared that should the United States participate in the war, it would be on the side of the Central Powers given US anti-colonial stance on the British Empire. </span>

	<span id="sent324">This resulted in increased tensions with Berlin and London. </span>

	<span id="sent325">When a German U-boat sank the British liner Lusitania in 1915, with 128 Americans aboard, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson vowed, ``America is too proud to fight'' and demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships. </span>

	<span id="sent326">Germany complied. </span>

	<span id="sent327">Wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement. </span>

	<span id="sent328">He repeatedly warned the U.S. would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, in violation of international law and U.S. ideas of human rights. </span>

	<span id="sent329">Wilson was under pressure from former president Theodore Roosevelt, who denounced German acts as ``piracy''. Wilson's desire to have a seat at negotiations at war's end to advance the League of Nations also played a role. </span>

	<span id="sent330">Wilson's Secretary of State, William Jennings Bryan, resigned in protest at what he felt was the President's decidedly warmongering diplomacy. </span>

	<span id="sent331">Other factors contributing to the U.S. entry into the war include the suspected German sabotage of both Black Tom in Jersey City, New Jersey, and the Kingsland Explosion in what is now Lyndhurst, New Jersey.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent332">In January 1917, after the Navy pressured the Kaiser, Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare. </span>

	<span id="sent333">Britain's secret Royal Navy cryptanalytic group, Room 40, had broken the German diplomatic code. </span>

	<span id="sent334">They intercepted a proposal from Berlin (the Zimmermann Telegram) to Mexico to join the war as Germany's ally against the United States, should the U.S. join. </span>

	<span id="sent335">The proposal suggested that if the U.S. were to enter the war then Mexico should declare war against the United States and enlist Japan as an ally. </span>

	<span id="sent336">This would prevent the United States from joining the Allies and deploying troops to Europe, and would give Germany more time for their unrestricted submarine warfare program to strangle Britain's vital war supplies. </span>

	<span id="sent337">In return, the Germans would promise Mexico support in reclaiming the territory of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona that Mexico lost during the Mexican-American War 70 years prior.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent338">After the British revealed the telegram to the United States, President Wilson, who had won reelection on his keeping the country out of the war, released the captured telegram as a way of building support for U.S. entry into the war. </span>

	<span id="sent339">He had previously claimed neutrality, while calling for the arming of U.S. merchant ships delivering munitions to combatant Britain and quietly supporting the British blockading of German ports and mining of international waters, preventing the shipment of food from America and elsewhere to combatant Germany. </span>

	<span id="sent340">After submarines sank seven U.S. merchant ships and the publication of the Zimmerman telegram, Wilson called for war on Germany, which the U.S. Congress declared on 6 April 1917.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent341">Crucial to U.S. participation was the sweeping domestic propaganda campaign executed by the Committee on Public Information overseen by George Creel. </span>

	<span id="sent342">The campaign included tens of thousands of government-selected community leaders giving brief carefully scripted pro-war speeches at thousands of public gatherings. </span>

	<span id="sent343">Along with other branches of government and private vigilante groups like the American Protective League, it also included the general repression and harassment of people either opposed to American entry into the war or of German heritage. </span>

	<span id="sent344">Other forms of propaganda included newsreels, photos, large-print posters (designed by several well-known illustrators of the day, including Louis D. Fancher and Henry Reuterdahl), magazine and newspaper articles, etc. </span>

	<span id="sent345">Additionally, during World War I, Woodrow Wilson placed a great importance on children, especially the Boy Scouts of America, asking them to encourage war support and educate the public about the importance of the war. </span>

	<span id="sent346">They helped distribute these war pamphlets, helped sell war bonds, and helped to drive nationalism and support for the war.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent347">The United States was never formally a member of the Allies but became a self-styled ``Associated Power''. </span>

	<span id="sent348">The United States had a small army, but, after the passage of the Selective Service Act, it drafted four million men and by summer 1918 was sending 10,000 fresh soldiers to France every day. </span>

	<span id="sent349">In 1917, the U.S. Congress gave U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans when they were drafted to participate in World War I, as part of the Jones Act. </span>

	<span id="sent350">Germany had miscalculated, believing it would be many more months before they would arrive and that the arrival could be stopped by U-boats.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent351">The United States Navy sent a battleship group to Scapa Flow to join with the British Grand Fleet, destroyers to Queenstown, Ireland and submarines to help guard convoys. </span>

	<span id="sent352">Several regiments of U.S. Marines were also dispatched to France. </span>

	<span id="sent353">The British and French wanted U.S. units used to reinforce their troops already on the battle lines and not waste scarce shipping on bringing over supplies. </span>

	<span id="sent354">The U.S. rejected the first proposition and accepted the second. </span>

	<span id="sent355">General John J. Pershing, American Expeditionary Force (AEF) commander, refused to break up U.S. units to be used as reinforcements for British Empire and French units. </span>

	<span id="sent356">As an exception, he did allow African-American combat regiments to be used in French divisions. </span>

	<span id="sent357">The Harlem Hellfighters fought as part of the French 16th Division, earning a unit Croix de Guerre for their actions at Chateau-Thierry, Belleau Wood and Sechault. </span>

	<span id="sent358">AEF doctrine called for the use of frontal assaults, which had long since been discarded by British Empire and French commanders because of the large loss of life.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent359">Austrian offer of separate peace.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent360">In 1917, Emperor Charles I of Austria secretly attempted separate peace negotiations with Clemenceau, with his wife's brother Sixtus in Belgium as an intermediary, without the knowledge of Germany. </span>

	<span id="sent361">When the negotiations failed, his attempt was revealed to Germany, a diplomatic catastrophe.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent362">German Spring Offensive of 1918.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent363">German General Erich Ludendorff drew up plans ( codenamed Operation Michael) for the 1918 offensive on the Western Front. </span>

	<span id="sent364">The Spring Offensive sought to divide the British and French forces with a series of feints and advances. </span>

	<span id="sent365">The German leadership hoped to strike a decisive blow before significant U.S. forces arrived. </span>

	<span id="sent366">The operation commenced on 21 March 1918 with an attack on British forces near Amiens. </span>

	<span id="sent367">German forces achieved an unprecedented advance of 60 kilometres (40 miles).<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent368">British and French trenches were penetrated using novel infiltration tactics, also named Hutier tactics, after General Oskar von Hutier. </span>

	<span id="sent369">Previously, attacks had been characterized by long artillery bombardments and massed assaults. </span>

	<span id="sent370">However, in the Spring Offensive of 1918, Ludendorff used artillery only briefly and infiltrated small groups of infantry at weak points. </span>

	<span id="sent371">They attacked command and logistics areas and bypassed points of serious resistance. </span>

	<span id="sent372">More heavily armed infantry then destroyed these isolated positions. </span>

	<span id="sent373">German success relied greatly on the element of surprise.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent374">The front moved to within 120 kilometers (75 mi) of Paris. </span>

	<span id="sent375">Three heavy Krupp railway guns fired 183 shells on the capital, causing many Parisians to flee. </span>

	<span id="sent376">The initial offensive was so successful that Kaiser Wilhelm II declared 24 March a national holiday. </span>

	<span id="sent377">Many Germans thought victory was near. </span>

	<span id="sent378">After heavy fighting, however, the offensive was halted. </span>

	<span id="sent379">Lacking tanks or motorised artillery, the Germans were unable to consolidate their gains. </span>

	<span id="sent380">This situation was not helped by the supply lines now being stretched as a result of their advance. </span>

	<span id="sent381">The sudden stop was also a result of the four Australian Imperial Force (AIF) divisions that were ``rushed'' down, thus doing what no other army had done and stopping the German advance in its tracks. </span>

	<span id="sent382">During that time the first Australian division was hurriedly sent north again to stop the second German breakthrough.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent383">American divisions, which Pershing had sought to field as an independent force, were assigned to the depleted French and British Empire commands on 28 March. </span>

	<span id="sent384">A Supreme War Council of Allied forces was created at the Doullens Conference on 5 November 1917. </span>

	<span id="sent385">General Foch was appointed as supreme commander of the allied forces. </span>

	<span id="sent386">Haig, Petain and Pershing retained tactical control of their respective armies; Foch assumed a coordinating role, rather than a directing role and the British, French and U.S. commands operated largely independently.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent387">Following Operation Michael, Germany launched Operation Georgette against the northern English channel ports. </span>

	<span id="sent388">The Allies halted the drive with limited territorial gains for Germany. </span>

	<span id="sent389">The German Army to the south then conducted Operations Blucher and Yorck, broadly towards Paris. </span>

	<span id="sent390">Operation Marne was launched on 15 July, attempting to encircle Reims and beginning the Second Battle of the Marne. </span>

	<span id="sent391">The resulting counterattack, starting the Hundred Days Offensive, marked their first successful Allied offensive of the war.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent392">By 20 July the Germans were back across the Marne at their Kaiserschlacht starting lines, having achieved nothing. </span>

	<span id="sent393">Following this last phase of the war in the West, the German Army never again regained the initiative. </span>

	<span id="sent394">German casualties between March and April 1918 were 270,000, including many highly trained stormtroops.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent395">Meanwhile, Germany was falling apart at home. </span>

	<span id="sent396">Anti-war marches became frequent and morale in the army fell. </span>

	<span id="sent397">Industrial output was 53% of 1913 levels.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent398">New states under war zone.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent399">In 1918, the internationally recognized Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, Democratic Republic of Armenia and Democratic Republic of Georgia bordering the Ottoman Empire and Russian Empire were established, as well as the unrecognized Centrocaspian Dictatorship and South West Caucasian Republic. </span>

	<span id="sent400">Later, these unrecognized states were eliminated by Azerbaijan and Turkey.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent401">In 1918, the Dashnaks of the Armenian national liberation movement declared the Democratic Republic of Armenia (DRA) through the Armenian Congress of Eastern Armenians (unified form of Armenian National Councils) after the dissolution of the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. </span>

	<span id="sent402">Tovmas Nazarbekian became the first Commander-in-chief of the DRA. </span>

	<span id="sent403">Enver Pasha ordered the creation of a new army to be named the Army of Islam. </span>

	<span id="sent404">He ordered the Army of Islam into the DRA, with the goal of taking Baku on the Caspian Sea. </span>

	<span id="sent405">This new offensive was strongly opposed by the Germans. </span>

	<span id="sent406">In early May 1918, the Ottoman army attacked the newly declared DRA. </span>

	<span id="sent407">Although the Armenians managed to inflict one defeat on the Ottomans at the Battle of Sardarapat, the Ottoman army won a later battle and scattered the Armenian army. </span>

	<span id="sent408">The Republic of Armenia signed the Treaty of Batum in June 1918.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent409">Allied victory: summer and autumn 1918.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent410">The Allied counteroffensive, known as the Hundred Days Offensive, began on 8 August 1918. </span>

	<span id="sent411">The Battle of Amiens developed with III Corps Fourth British Army on the left, the First French Army on the right, and the Australian and Canadian Corps spearheading the offensive in the centre through Harbonnieres. </span>

	<span id="sent412">It involved 414 tanks of the Mark IV and Mark V type, and 120,000 men. </span>

	<span id="sent413">They advanced 12 kilometers (7 miles) into German-held territory in just seven hours. </span>

	<span id="sent414">Erich Ludendorff referred to this day as the ``Black Day of the German army''.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent415">The Australian-Canadian spearhead at Amiens, a battle that was the beginning of Germany's downfall, helped pull the British armies to the north and the French armies to the south forward. </span>

	<span id="sent416">While German resistance on the British Fourth Army front at Amiens stiffened, after an advance as far as 14 miles (23 km) and concluded the battle there, the French Third Army lengthened the Amiens front on 10 August, when it was thrown in on the right of the French First Army, and advanced 4 miles (6 km) liberating Lassigny in fighting which lasted until 16 August. </span>

	<span id="sent417">South of the French Third Army, General Charles Mangin (The Butcher) drove his French Tenth Army forward at Soissons on 20 August to capture eight thousand prisoners, two hundred guns and the Aisne heights overlooking and menacing the German position north of the Vesle. </span>

	<span id="sent418">Another ``Black day'' as described by Erich Ludendorff.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent419">Meanwhile General Byng of the Third British Army, reporting that the enemy on his front was thinning in a limited withdrawal, was ordered to attack with 200 tanks toward Bapaume, opening the Battle of Albert, with the specific orders of ``To break the enemy's front, in order to outflank the enemies present battle front'' (opposite the British Fourth Army at Amiens). </span>

	<span id="sent420">Allied leaders had now realized that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives and it was better to turn a line than to try and roll over it. </span>

	<span id="sent421">Attacks were being undertaken in quick order to take advantage of the successful advances on the flanks and then broken off when that attack lost its initial impetus.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent422">The British Third Army's 15-mile (24 km) front north of Albert progressed after stalling for a day against the main resistance line to which the enemy had withdrawn. </span>

	<span id="sent423">Rawlinson's Fourth British Army was able to battle its left flank forward between Albert and the Somme straightening the line between the advanced positions of the Third Army and the Amiens front which resulted in recapturing Albert at the same time. </span>

	<span id="sent424">On 26 August the British First Army on the left of the Third Army was drawn into the battle extending it northward to beyond Arras. </span>

	<span id="sent425">The Canadian Corps already being back in the vanguard of the First Army fought their way from Arras eastward 5 miles (8 km) astride the heavily defended Arras-Cambrai before reaching the outer defences of the Hindenburg line, breaching them on the 28 and 29 August. </span>

	<span id="sent426">Bapaume fell on the 29 August to the New Zealand Division of the Third Army and the Australians, still leading the advance of the Fourth Army, were again able to push forward at Amiens to take Peronne and Mont St. Quentin on 31 August. </span>

	<span id="sent427">Further south the French First and Third Armies had slowly fought forward while the Tenth Army, who had by now crossed the Ailette and was east of the Chemin des Dames, was now near to the Alberich position of the Hindenburg line. </span>

	<span id="sent428">During the last week of August the pressure along a 70-mile (113 km) front against the enemy was heavy and unrelenting. </span>

	<span id="sent429">From German accounts, ``Each day was spent in bloody fighting against an ever and again on-storming enemy, and nights passed without sleep in retirements to new lines.'' </span>

	<span id="sent430">Even to the north in Flanders the British Second and Fifth Armies during August and September were able to make progress taking prisoners and positions that were previously denied them.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent431">On 2 September the Canadian Corps outflanking of the Hindenburg line, with the breaching of the Wotan Position, made it possible for the Third Army to advance and sent repercussions all along the Western Front. </span>

	<span id="sent432">That same day Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL) had no choice but to issue orders to six armies for withdrawal back into the Hindenburg line in the south, behind the Canal Du Nord on the Canadian-First Army's front and back to a line east of the Lys in the north, giving up without a fight the salient seized in the previous April. </span>

	<span id="sent433">According to Ludendorff We had to admit the necessityto withdraw the entire front from the Scarpe to the Vesle.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent434">In nearly four weeks of fighting since 8 August over 100,000 German prisoners were taken, 75,000 by the BEF and the rest by the French. </span>

	<span id="sent435">Since ``The Black Day of the German Army'' the German High Command realized the war was lost and made attempts for a satisfactory end. </span>

	<span id="sent436">The day after the battle Ludenforff told Colonel Mertz ``We cannot win the war any more, but we must not lose it either.'' </span>

	<span id="sent437">On 11 August he offered his resignation to the Kaiser, who refused it and replied, ``I see that we must strike a balance. </span>

	<span id="sent438">We have nearly reached the limit of our powers of resistance. </span>

	<span id="sent439">The war must be ended.`` </span>

	<span id="sent440">On 13 August at Spa, Hindenburg, Ludendorff, Chancellor and Foreign minister Hintz agreed that the war could not be ended militarily and on the following day the German Crown Council decided victory in the field was now most improbable. </span>

	<span id="sent441">Austria and Hungary warned that they could only continue the war until December and Ludendorff recommended immediate peace negotiations, to which the Kaiser responded by instructing Hintz to seek the Queen of Holland's mediation. </span>

	<span id="sent442">Prince Rupprecht warned Prince Max of Baden ``Our military situation has deteriorated so rapidly that I no longer believe we can hold out over the winter; it is even possible that a catastrophe will come earlier.'' </span>

	<span id="sent443">On 10 September Hindenburg urged peace moves to Emperor Charles of Austria and Germany appealed to Holland for mediation. </span>

	<span id="sent444">On the 14 September Austria sent a note to all belligerents and neutrals suggesting a meeting for peace talks on neutral soil and on 15 September Germany made a peace offer to Belgium. </span>

	<span id="sent445">Both peace offers were rejected and on 24 September OHL informed the leaders in Berlin that armistice talks were inevitable.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent446">September saw the Germans continuing to fight strong rear guard actions and launching numerous counter attacks on lost positions, with only a few succeeding and then only temporarily. </span>

	<span id="sent447">Contested towns, villages, heights and trenches in the screening positions and outposts of the Hindenburg Line continued to fall to the Allies, with the BEF alone taking 30,441 prisoners in the last week of September. </span>

	<span id="sent448">Further small advances eastward would follow the Third Army victory at Ivincourt on 12 September, the Fourth Armies at Epheny on 18 September and the French gain of Essigny-le-Grand a day later. </span>

	<span id="sent449">On 24 September a final assault by both the British and French on a 4 mile (6 km) front would come within 2 miles (3 km) of St. Quentin. </span>

	<span id="sent450">With the outposts and preliminary defensive lines of the Siegfried and Alberich Positions eliminated the Germans were now completely back in the Hindenburg line. </span>

	<span id="sent451">With the Wotan position of that line already breached and the Siegfried position in danger of being turned from the north the time had now come for an assault on the whole length of the line.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent452">The Allied attack on the Hindenburg Line began on 26 September including U.S. soldiers. </span>

	<span id="sent453">The still-green American troops suffered problems coping with supply trains for large units on a difficult landscape. </span>

	<span id="sent454">The following week cooperating French and American units broke through in Champagne at the Battle of Blanc Mont Ridge, forcing the Germans off the commanding heights, and closing towards the Belgian frontier. </span>

	<span id="sent455">The last Belgian town to be liberated before the armistice was Ghent, which the Germans held as a pivot until Allied artillery was brought up. </span>

	<span id="sent456">The German army had to shorten its front and use the Dutch frontier as an anchor to fight rear-guard actions.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent457">When Bulgaria signed a separate armistice on 29 September, the Allies gained control of Serbia and Greece. </span>

	<span id="sent458">Ludendorff, having been under great stress for months, suffered something similar to a breakdown. </span>

	<span id="sent459">It was evident that Germany could no longer mount a successful defence.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent460">Meanwhile, news of Germany's impending military defeat spread throughout the German armed forces. </span>

	<span id="sent461">The threat of mutiny was rife. </span>

	<span id="sent462">Admiral Reinhard Scheer and Ludendorff decided to launch a last attempt to restore the ``valour'' of the German Navy. </span>

	<span id="sent463">Knowing the government of Prince Maximilian of Baden would veto any such action, Ludendorff decided not to inform him. </span>

	<span id="sent464">Nonetheless, word of the impending assault reached sailors at Kiel. </span>

	<span id="sent465">Many rebelled and were arrested, refusing to be part of a naval offensive which they believed to be suicidal. </span>

	<span id="sent466">Ludendorff took the blame -the Kaiser dismissed him on 26 October. </span>

	<span id="sent467">The collapse of the Balkans meant that Germany was about to lose its main supplies of oil and food. </span>

	<span id="sent468">The reserves had been used up, but U.S. troops kept arriving at the rate of 10,000 per day.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent469">Having suffered over 6 million casualties, Germany moved toward peace. </span>

	<span id="sent470">Prince Maximilian of Baden took charge of a new government as Chancellor of Germany to negotiate with the Allies. </span>

	<span id="sent471">Telegraphic negotiations with President Wilson began immediately, in the vain hope that better terms would be offered than by the British and French. </span>

	<span id="sent472">Instead Wilson demanded the abdication of the Kaiser. </span>

	<span id="sent473">There was no resistance when the social democrat Philipp Scheidemann on 9 November declared Germany to be a republic. </span>

	<span id="sent474">Imperial Germany was dead; a new Germany had been born: the Weimar Republic.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent475">Armistices and capitulations.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent476">The collapse of the Central Powers came swiftly. </span>

	<span id="sent477">Bulgaria was the first to sign an armistice on 29 September 1918 at Saloniki. </span>

	<span id="sent478">On 30 October the Ottoman Empire capitulated at Mudros.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent479">On 24 October the Italians began a push which rapidly recovered territory lost after the Battle of Caporetto. </span>

	<span id="sent480">This culminated in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, which marked the end of the Austro-Hungarian Army as an effective fighting force. </span>

	<span id="sent481">The offensive also triggered the disintegration of Austro-Hungarian Empire. </span>

	<span id="sent482">During the last week of October declarations of independence were made in Budapest, Prague and Zagreb. </span>

	<span id="sent483">On 29 October, the imperial authorities asked Italy for an armistice. </span>

	<span id="sent484">But the Italians continued advancing, reaching Trento, Udine and Trieste. </span>

	<span id="sent485">On 3 November Austria -Hungary sent a flag of truce to ask for an Armistice. </span>

	<span id="sent486">The terms, arranged by telegraph with the Allied Authorities in Paris, were communicated to the Austrian Commander and accepted. </span>

	<span id="sent487">The Armistice with Austria was signed in the Villa Giusti, near Padua, on 3 November. </span>

	<span id="sent488">Austria and Hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the Habsburg monarchy.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent489">Following the outbreak of the German Revolution, a republic was proclaimed on 9 November. </span>

	<span id="sent490">The Kaiser fled to the Netherlands. </span>

	<span id="sent491">On 11 November an armistice with Germany was signed in a railroad carriage at Compiegne. </span>

	<span id="sent492">At 11 a.m. on 11 November 1918; ``the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month''; a ceasefire came into effect. </span>

	<span id="sent493">Opposing armies on the Western Front began to withdraw from their positions. </span>

	<span id="sent494">Canadian Private George Lawrence Price is traditionally regarded as the last soldier killed in the Great War: he was shot by a German sniper at 10:57 and died at 10:58.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent495">Allied superiority and the stab-in-the-back legend, November 1918.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent496">In November 1918 the Allies had ample supplies of men and materiel to invade Germany; at the time of the armistice, no Allied soldier had set foot on German soil in anger and Berlin was still almost 900 mi (1,400 km) from the Western Front. </span>

	<span id="sent497">The Kaiser's armies had also retreated from the battlefield in good order which enabled Hindenburg and other senior German leaders to spread the story that their armies had not really been defeated. </span>

	<span id="sent498">This resulted in the stab-in-the-back legend which attributed Germany's losing the war not to its inability to continue fighting, (even though up to a million soldiers were suffering from the Spanish Flu and unfit to fight) but to the public's failure to respond to its ``patriotic calling'' and the intentional sabotaging of the war effort, particularly by Jews, Socialists and Bolsheviks.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent499">A formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months, until signing of the Treaty of Versailles with Germany on 28 June 1919. </span>

	<span id="sent500">Later treaties with Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire were signed. </span>

	<span id="sent501">However, the latter treaty with the Ottoman Empire was followed by strife (the Turkish Independence War) and a final peace treaty was signed between the Allied Powers and the country that would shortly become the Republic of Turkey, at Lausanne on 24 July 1923.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent502">Some war memorials date the end of the war as being when the Versailles treaty was signed in 1919; by contrast, most commemorations of the war's end concentrate on the armistice of 11 November 1918. </span>

	<span id="sent503">Legally the last formal peace treaties were not signed until the Treaty of Lausanne. </span>

	<span id="sent504">Under its terms, the Allied forces divested Constantinople on 23 August 1923.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent505">Technology.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent506">The First World War began as a clash of twentieth century technology and nineteenth century tactics, with inevitably large casualties. </span>

	<span id="sent507">By the end of 1917, however, the major armies, now numbering millions of men, had modernized and were making use of telephone, wireless communication, armoured cars, tanks, and aircraft. </span>

	<span id="sent508">Infantry formations were reorganized, so that 100 man companies were no longer the main unit of maneuver. </span>

	<span id="sent509">Instead, squads of 10 or so men, under the command of a junior NCO, were favoured. </span>

	<span id="sent510">Artillery also underwent a revolution.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent511">In 1914, cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets. </span>

	<span id="sent512">By 1917, indirect fire with guns (as well as mortars and even machine guns) was commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably aircraft and the often overlooked field telephone. </span>

	<span id="sent513">Counter-battery missions became commonplace, also, and sound detection was used to locate enemy batteries.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent514">Germany was far ahead of the Allies in utilising heavy indirect fire. </span>

	<span id="sent515">She employed 150 and 210 mm howitzers in 1914 when the typical French and British guns were only 75 and 105 mm. </span>

	<span id="sent516">The British had a 6 inch (152 mm) howitzer, but it was so heavy it had to be hauled to the field in pieces and assembled. </span>

	<span id="sent517">Germans also fielded Austrian 305 mm and 420 mm guns, and already by the beginning of the war had inventories of various calibers of Minenwerfer ideally suited for trench warfare.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent518">Much of the combat involved trench warfare, where hundreds often died for each yard gained. </span>

	<span id="sent519">Many of the deadliest battles in history occurred during the First World War. </span>

	<span id="sent520">Such battles include Ypres, the Marne, Cambrai, the Somme, Verdun, and Gallipoli. </span>

	<span id="sent521">The Haber process of nitrogen fixation was employed to provide the German forces with a constant supply of gunpowder, in the face of British naval blockade. </span>

	<span id="sent522">Artillery was responsible for the largest number of casualties and consumed vast quantities of explosives. </span>

	<span id="sent523">The large number of head-wounds caused by exploding shells and fragmentation forced the combatant nations to develop the modern steel helmet, led by the French, who introduced the Adrian helmet in 1915. </span>

	<span id="sent524">It was quickly followed by the Brodie helmet, worn by British Imperial and U.S. troops, and in 1916 by the distinctive German Stahlhelm, a design, with improvements, still in use today.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent525">The widespread use of chemical warfare was a distinguishing feature of the conflict. </span>

	<span id="sent526">Gases used included chlorine, mustard gas and phosgene. </span>

	<span id="sent527">Few war casualties were caused by gas, as effective countermeasures to gas attacks were quickly created, such as gas masks. </span>

	<span id="sent528">The use of chemical warfare and small-scale strategic bombing were both outlawed by the 1907 Hague Conventions, and both proved to be of limited effectiveness, though they captured the public imagination.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent529">The most powerful land-based weapons were railway guns weighing hundreds of tons apiece. </span>

	<span id="sent530">These were nicknamed Big Berthas, even though the namesake was not a railway gun. </span>

	<span id="sent531">Germany developed the Paris Gun, able to bombard Paris from over 100 kilometres (60 mi), though shells were relatively light at 94 kilograms (210 lb). </span>

	<span id="sent532">While the Allies had railway guns, German models severely out-ranged and out-classed them.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent533">Fixed-wing aircraft were first used militarily by the Italians in Libya 23 October 1911 during the Italo-Turkish War for reconnaissance, soon followed by the dropping of grenades and aerial photography the next year. </span>

	<span id="sent534">By 1914 the military utility was obvious. </span>

	<span id="sent535">They were initially used for reconnaissance and ground attack. </span>

	<span id="sent536">To shoot down enemy planes, anti-aircraft guns and fighter aircraft were developed. </span>

	<span id="sent537">Strategic bombers were created, principally by the Germans and British, though the former used Zeppelins as well. </span>

	<span id="sent538">Towards the end of the conflict, aircraft carriers were used for the first time, with HMS Furious launching Sopwith Camels in a raid to destroy the Zeppelin hangars at Tondern in 1918.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent539">German U-boats ( submarines) were deployed after the war began. </span>

	<span id="sent540">Alternating between restricted and unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic, they were employed by the Kaiserliche Marine in a strategy to deprive the British Isles of vital supplies. </span>

	<span id="sent541">The deaths of British merchant sailors and the seeming invulnerability of U-boats led to the development of depth charges (1916), hydrophones (passive sonar, 1917), blimps, hunter-killer submarines ( HMS R&-1, 1917), forward-throwing anti-submarine weapons, and dipping hydrophones (the latter two both abandoned in 1918). </span>

	<span id="sent542">To extend their operations, the Germans proposed supply submarines (1916). </span>

	<span id="sent543">Most of these would be forgotten in the interwar period until World War II revived the need.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent544">Trenches, machineguns, air reconnaissance, barbed wire, and modern artillery with fragmentation shells helped bring the battle lines of World War I to a stalemate. </span>

	<span id="sent545">The British sought a solution with the creation of the tank and mechanized warfare. </span>

	<span id="sent546">The first tanks were used during the Battle of the Somme on 15 September 1916. </span>

	<span id="sent547">Mechanical reliability became an issue, but the experiment proved its worth. </span>

	<span id="sent548">Within a year, the British were fielding tanks by the hundreds and showed their potential during the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917, by breaking the Hindenburg Line, while combined arms teams captured 8000 enemy soldiers and 100 guns. </span>

	<span id="sent549">Light automatic weapons also were introduced, such as the Lewis Gun and Browning automatic rifle.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent550">Manned observation balloons, floating high above the trenches, were used as stationary reconnaissance platforms, reporting enemy movements and directing artillery. </span>

	<span id="sent551">Balloons commonly had a crew of two, equipped with parachutes. </span>

	<span id="sent552">If there was an enemy air attack, the crew could parachute to safety. </span>

	<span id="sent553">At the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots of aircraft (with their marginal power output) and smaller versions would not be developed until the end of the war; they were also opposed by British leadership, who feared they might promote cowardice. </span>

	<span id="sent554">Recognized for their value as observation platforms, balloons were important targets of enemy aircraft.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent555">To defend against air attack, they were heavily protected by antiaircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft; to attack them, unusual weapons such as air-to-air rockets were even tried. </span>

	<span id="sent556">Blimps and balloons contributed to air-to-air combat among aircraft, because of their reconnaissance value, and to the trench stalemate, because it was impossible to move large numbers of troops undetected. </span>

	<span id="sent557">The Germans conducted air raids on England during 1915 and 1916 with airships, hoping to damage British morale and cause aircraft to be diverted from the front lines. </span>

	<span id="sent558">The resulting panic took several squadrons of fighters from France.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent559">Another new weapon, flamethrowers, were first used by the German army and later adopted by other forces. </span>

	<span id="sent560">Although not of high tactical value, they were a powerful, demoralizing weapon and caused terror on the battlefield. </span>

	<span id="sent561">It was a dangerous weapon to wield, as its heavy weight made operators vulnerable targets.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent562">Trench railways evolved to supply the enormous quantities of food, water, and ammunition required to support large numbers of soldiers in areas where conventional transportation systems had been destroyed. </span>

	<span id="sent563">Internal combustion engines and improved traction systems for wheeled vehicles eventually rendered trench railways obsolete.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent564">War crimes.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent565">Genocide and ethnic cleansing.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent566">Ottoman Empire.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent567">The ethnic cleansing of the Ottoman Empire's Christian population, with the most prominent among them being the deportation and massacres of Armenians (similar policies were enacted against the Assyrians and Ottoman Greeks) during the final years of the Ottoman Empire is considered genocide. </span>

	<span id="sent568">The Ottomans saw the entire Armenian population as an enemy that had chosen to side with Russia at the beginning of the war. </span>

	<span id="sent569">In early 1915, a number of Armenian nationalist groups such as the Armenakan, Dashnak and Hunchak organizations joined the Russian forces, and the Ottoman government used this as a pretext to issue the Tehcir Law which started the deportation of the Armenians from eastern Anatolia to Syria between 1915 and 1917. </span>

	<span id="sent570">The exact number of deaths is unknown, although Balakian gives a range of 250,000 to 1.5 million for the deaths of Armenians, the International Association of Genocide Scholars estimates over 1 million. </span>

	<span id="sent571">The government of Turkey has consistently rejected charges of genocide, arguing that those who died were victims of inter-ethnic fighting, famine or disease during the First World War.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent572">Russian Empire.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent573">Approximately 200,000 Germans living in Volhynia and about 600,000 Jews were deported by the Russian authorities. </span>

	<span id="sent574">In 1916, an order was issued to deport around 650,000 Volga Germans to the east as well, but the Russian Revolution prevented this from being carried out. </span>

	<span id="sent575">Many pogroms accompanied the Revolution of 1917 and the ensuing Russian Civil War, 60,000 -200,000 civilian Jews were killed in the atrocities throughout the former Russian Empire.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent576">Rape of Belgium.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent577">In Belgium, German troops, in fear of French and Belgian guerrilla fighters, or francs-tireurs, massacred townspeople in Andenne (211 dead), Tamines (384 dead), and Dinant (612 dead). </span>

	<span id="sent578">On 25 August 1914, the Germans set fire to the town of Leuven, burned the library containing about 230,000 books, killed 209 civilians and forced 42,000 to evacuate. </span>

	<span id="sent579">These actions brought worldwide condemnation.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent580">Soldiers' experiences.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent581">The soldiers of the war were initially volunteers, except for Italy, but increasingly were conscripted into service. </span>

	<span id="sent582">Britain's Imperial War Museum has collected more than 2,500 recordings of soldiers' personal accounts and selected transcripts, edited by military author Max Arthur, have been published. </span>

	<span id="sent583">The museum believes that historians have not taken full account of this material and accordingly has made the full archive of recordings available to authors and researchers. </span>

	<span id="sent584">Surviving veterans, returning home, often found that they could only discuss their experiences amongst themselves. </span>

	<span id="sent585">Grouping together, they formed ``veterans' associations'' or ``Legions'', as listed at Category:Veterans' organizations.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent586">Prisoners of the war.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent587">About 8 million men surrendered and were held in POW camps during the war. </span>

	<span id="sent588">All nations pledged to follow the Hague Convention on fair treatment of prisoners of war. </span>

	<span id="sent589">A POW's rate of survival was generally much higher than their peers at the front. </span>

	<span id="sent590">Individual surrenders were uncommon. </span>

	<span id="sent591">Large units usually surrendered en masse. </span>

	<span id="sent592">At the Battle of Tannenberg 92,000 Russians surrendered. </span>

	<span id="sent593">When the besieged garrison of Kaunas surrendered in 1915, some 20,000 Russians became prisoners. </span>

	<span id="sent594">Over half of Russian losses were prisoners (as a proportion of those captured, wounded or killed); for Austria-Hungary 32%, for Italy 26%, for France 12%, for Germany 9%; for Britain 7%. </span>

	<span id="sent595">Prisoners from the Allied armies totalled about 1.4 million (not including Russia, which lost 2.-3.5 million men as prisoners.) </span>

	<span id="sent596">From the Central Powers about 3.3 million men became prisoners.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent597">Germany held 2.5 million prisoners; Russia held 2.9 million; while Britain and France held about 720,000. </span>

	<span id="sent598">Most were captured just prior to the Armistice. </span>

	<span id="sent599">The U.S. held 48,000. </span>

	<span id="sent600">The most dangerous moment was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes gunned down. </span>

	<span id="sent601">Once prisoners reached a camp, in general, conditions were satisfactory (and much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the International Red Cross and inspections by neutral nations. </span>

	<span id="sent602">Conditions were terrible in Russia, starvation was common for prisoners and civilians alike; about 15 -20% of the prisoners in Russia died. </span>

	<span id="sent603">In Germany food was scarce, but only 5% died.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent604">The Ottoman Empire often treated POWs poorly. </span>

	<span id="sent605">Some 11,800 British Empire soldiers, most of them Indians, became prisoners after the Siege of Kut, in Mesopotamia, in April 1916; 4,250 died in captivity. </span>

	<span id="sent606">Although many were in very bad condition when captured, Ottoman officers forced them to march 1,100 kilometres (684 mi) to Anatolia. </span>

	<span id="sent607">A survivor said: ``we were driven along like beasts, to drop out was to die.'' </span>

	<span id="sent608">The survivors were then forced to build a railway through the Taurus Mountains.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent609">In Russia, where the prisoners from the Czech Legion of the Austro-Hungarian army were released in 1917 they re-armed themselves and briefly became a military and diplomatic force during the Russian Civil War.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent610">While the Allied prisoners of the Axis were quickly sent home at the end of active hostilities, the same treatment was not granted to Central Power prisoners of the Allies and Russia, many of which had to serve as forced labor, e.g. in France until 1920. </span>

	<span id="sent611">They were only released after many approaches by the ICRC to the Allied Supreme Council. </span>

	<span id="sent612">There were still German prisoners being held in Russia as late as 1924.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent613">Military attaches and war correspondents.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent614">Military and civilian observers from every major power closely followed the course of the war. </span>

	<span id="sent615">Many were able to report on events from a perspective somewhat like what is now termed `` embedded'' positions within the opposing land and naval forces. </span>

	<span id="sent616">These military attaches and other observers prepared voluminous first-hand accounts of the war and analytical papers.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent617">For example, former U.S. Army Captain Granville Fortescue followed the developments of the Gallipoli campaign from an embedded perspective within the ranks of the Turkish defenders; and his report was passed through Turkish censors before being printed in London and New York. </span>

	<span id="sent618">However, this observer's role was abandoned when the U.S. entered the war, as Fortescue immediately re-enlisted, sustaining wounds at Montfaucon d'Argonne in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, September 1918.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent619">In-depth observer narratives of the war and more narrowly focused professional journal articles were written soon after the war; and these post-war reports conclusively illustrated the battlefield destructiveness of this conflict. </span>

	<span id="sent620">This was the not first time the tactics of entrenched positions for infantry defended with machine guns and artillery became vitally important. </span>

	<span id="sent621">The Russo-Japanese War had been closely observed by Military attaches, war correspondents and other observers; but, from a 21st Century perspective, it is now apparent that a range of tactical lessons were disregarded or not used in the preparations for war in Europe and throughout the Great War.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent622">An early recorded use of the term ``World War'' is attributed to a well-known journalist for The Times, Colonel Charles Repington, who wrote in his diary on 10 September 1918: ``We discussed the right name of the war. </span>

	<span id="sent623">I said the we called it now The War, but that this could not last. </span>

	<span id="sent624">The Napoleonic War was The Great War. </span>

	<span id="sent625">To call it The German War was too much flattery for the Boche. </span>

	<span id="sent626">I suggested The World War as a shade better title, and finally we mutually agreed to call it The First World War in order to prevent the millennium folk from forgetting that the history of the world was the history of war.``<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent627">Support and opposition to the war.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent628">Support.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent629">The war was primarily supported by nationalists, industrial producers, and imperialists.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent630">In the Balkans, Yugoslav nationalists such as Yugoslav nationalist leader Ante Trumbic in the Balkans strongly supported the war, desiring the freedom of Yugoslavs from Austria-Hungary and other foreign powers and the creation of an independent Yugoslavia. </span>

	<span id="sent631">The Yugoslav Committee was formed in Paris on 30 April 1915 but shortly moved its office to London, Trumbic led the Committee.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent632">In the Middle East, Arab nationalism soared in Ottoman territories in response to the rise of Turkish nationalism during the war, with Arab nationalist leaders advocating the creation of a pan-Arab state. </span>

	<span id="sent633">In 1916, the Arab Revolt began in Ottoman-controlled territories of the Middle East in an effort to achieve independence.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent634">Italian nationalism was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions. </span>

	<span id="sent635">One of the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of the war was Gabriele d'Annunzio who promoted Italian irredentism and helped sway the Italian public to support intervention in the war. </span>

	<span id="sent636">The Italian Liberal Party under the leadership of Paolo Boselli promoted intervention in the war on the side of the Allies and utilized the Dante Aligheri Society to promote Italian nationalism.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent637">A number of socialist parties initially supported the war when it began in August 1914. </span>

	<span id="sent638">Initially European socialists became split on national lines with the conception of class conflict held by radical socialists such as Marxists and syndicalists being overstepped by their support for war. </span>

	<span id="sent639">Once the war began, Austrian, British, French, German and Russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current by supporting their country's intervention in the war.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent640">David Lloyd George, leader of the Labour Party of the United Kingdom decided to support the war while dissidents to this decision split to form the Independent Labour Party.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent641">Italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose it, some were militant supporters of the war including Benito Mussolini and Leonida Bissolati. </span>

	<span id="sent642">However the Italian Socialist Party decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors had been killed, resulting in a general strike called Red Week. </span>

	<span id="sent643">The Italian Socialist Party purged itself of pro-war nationalist members, including Mussolini. </span>

	<span id="sent644">Mussolini, a syndicalist who supported the war on grounds of irredentist claims on Italian-populated regions of Austria-Hungary, formed the pro-interventionist Il Popolo d'Italia and the Fasci Riviluzionario d'Azione Internazionalista (``Revolutionary Fasci for International Action'') in October 1914 that later developed into the Fasci di Combattimento in 1919 and the origin of fascism. </span>

	<span id="sent645">Mussolini's nationalism enabled him to raise funds from Ansaldo (an armaments firm) and other companies to create Il Popolo d'Italia to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent646">In April 1918 the Rome Congress of Oppressed Nationalities was held that included Czechoslovak, Italian, Polish, Transylvanian, and Yugoslav representatives that urged the Allies to support national self-determination for the peoples residing within Austria-Hungary.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent647">Opposition.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent648">The trade union and socialist movements had long voiced their opposition to a war, which they argued, meant only that workers would kill other workers in the interest of capitalism. </span>

	<span id="sent649">Once war was declared, however, many socialists and trade unions backed their governments. </span>

	<span id="sent650">Among the exceptions were the Bolsheviks, the Socialist Party of America, and the Italian Socialist Party, and individuals such as Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg and their followers in Germany. </span>

	<span id="sent651">There were also small anti-war groups in Britain and France.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent652">Many countries jailed those who spoke out against the conflict. </span>

	<span id="sent653">These included Eugene Debs in the United States and Bertrand Russell in Britain. </span>

	<span id="sent654">In the U.S., the 1917 Espionage Act effectively made free speech illegal and many served long prison sentences for statements of fact deemed unpatriotic. </span>

	<span id="sent655">The Sedition Act of 1918 made any statements deemed ``disloyal'' a federal crime. </span>

	<span id="sent656">Publications at all critical of the government were removed from circulation by postal censors.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent657">A number of nationalists opposed intervention, particularly within states that the nationalists held hostility to. </span>

	<span id="sent658">Irish nationalists staunchly opposed taking part in intervention with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. </span>

	<span id="sent659">The war had begun amid the Home Rule crisis in Ireland that had begun in 1912 and by 1914 there was a serious possibility of an outbreak of civil war in Ireland between Irish unionists and republicans. </span>

	<span id="sent660">Irish nationalists and Marxists attempted to pursue Irish independence, culminating in the Easter Rising of 1916, with Germany sending 20,000 rifles to Ireland in order stir unrest in the United Kingdom. </span>

	<span id="sent661">The UK government placed Ireland under martial law in response to the Easter Rising.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent662">Other opposition came from conscientious objectors  - some socialist, some religious  - who refused to fight. </span>

	<span id="sent663">In Britain 16,000 people asked for conscientious objector status. </span>

	<span id="sent664">Many suffered years of prison, including solitary confinement and bread and water diets. </span>

	<span id="sent665">Even after the war, in Britain many job advertisements were marked ``No conscientious objectors need apply''.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent666">The Central Asian Revolt started in the summer of 1916, when the Russian Empire government ended its exemption of Muslims from military service.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent667">In 1917, a series of mutinies in the French army led to dozens of soldiers being executed and many more imprisoned.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent668">In Milan in May 1917, Bolshevik revolutionaries organized and engaged in rioting calling for an end to the war, and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation. </span>

	<span id="sent669">The Italian army was forced to enter Milan with tanks and machine guns to face Bolsheviks and anarchists who fought violently until May 23 when the army gained control of the city with almost fifty people killed (three of which were Italian soldiers) and over 800 people arrested.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent670">The Conscription Crisis of 1917 in Canada erupted when conservative Prime Minister Robert Borden brought in compulsory military service over the objection of French-speaking Quebecers. </span>

	<span id="sent671">Out of approximately 625,000 Canadians who served, about 60,000 were killed and another 173,000 were wounded.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent672">In 1917, Emperor Charles I of Austria secretly entered into peace negotiations with the Allied powers, with his brother-in-law Sixtus as intermediary, without the knowledge of his ally Germany. </span>

	<span id="sent673">He failed, however, because of the resistance of Italy.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent674">In September 1917, the Russian soldiers in France began questioning why they were fighting for the French at all and mutinied. </span>

	<span id="sent675">In Russia, opposition to the war led to soldiers also establishing their own revolutionary committees and helped foment the October Revolution of 1917, with the call going up for ``bread, land, and peace''. </span>

	<span id="sent676">The Bolsheviks reached a peace treaty with Germany, the peace of Brest-Litovsk, despite its harsh conditions.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent677">The end of October 1918, in northern Germany, saw the beginning of the German Revolution of 1918 -19. </span>

	<span id="sent678">Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war which they saw as good as lost, initiating the uprising. </span>

	<span id="sent679">The sailors' revolt which then ensued in the naval ports of Wilhelmshaven and Kiel spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918 and shortly thereafter to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent680">Conscription.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent681">As the war slowly turned into a war of attrition, conscription was implemented in some countries. </span>

	<span id="sent682">This issue was particularly explosive in Canada and Australia. </span>

	<span id="sent683">In the former it opened a political gap between French-Canadians, who claimed their true loyalty was to Canada and not the British Empire, and the Anglophone majority who saw the war as a duty to both Britain and Canada. </span>

	<span id="sent684">Prime Minister Robert Borden pushed through a Military Service Act, provoking the Conscription Crisis of 1917. </span>

	<span id="sent685">In Australia, a sustained pro-conscription campaign by Prime Minister Billy Hughes, caused a split in the Australian Labor Party and Hughes formed the Nationalist Party of Australia in 1917 to pursue the matter. </span>

	<span id="sent686">Nevertheless, the labour movement, the Catholic Church, and Irish nationalist expatriates successfully opposed Hughes' push, which was rejected in two plebiscites.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent687">Conscription put into uniform nearly every physically fit man in Britain, six of ten million eligible. </span>

	<span id="sent688">Of these, about 750,000 lost their lives and 1,700,000 were wounded. </span>

	<span id="sent689">Most deaths were to young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent690">Aftermath.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent691">No other war had changed the map of Europe so dramatically -four empires disappeared: the German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman and the Russian. </span>

	<span id="sent692">Four defunct dynasties, the Hohenzollerns, the Habsburg, Romanovs and the Ottomans together with all their ancillary aristocracies, all fell after the war. </span>

	<span id="sent693">Belgium and Serbia were badly damaged, as was France with 1.4 million soldiers dead, not counting other casualties. </span>

	<span id="sent694">Germany and Russia were similarly affected.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent695">Of the 60 million European soldiers who were mobilized from 1914 -1918, 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured. </span>

	<span id="sent696">Germany lost 15.1% of its active male population, Austria -Hungary lost 17.1%, and France lost 10.5%. </span>

	<span id="sent697">About 750,000 German civilians died from starvation caused by the British blockade during the war. </span>

	<span id="sent698">By the end of the war, famine had killed approximately 100,000 people in Lebanon. </span>

	<span id="sent699">The war had profound economic consequences. </span>

	<span id="sent700">In addition, a major influenza epidemic spread around the world. </span>

	<span id="sent701">Overall, the Spanish flu killed at least 50 million people. </span>

	<span id="sent702">In 1914 alone, louse-borne epidemic typhus killed 200,000 in Serbia. </span>

	<span id="sent703">Whereas, before World War I, Russia had about three and one-half million cases of malaria, there were more than thirteen million in 1923.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent704">There were about 25 million infections and 3 million deaths from epidemic typhus in Russia from 1918 to 1922. </span>

	<span id="sent705">The best estimates of the death toll from the Russian famine of 1921 run from 5 million to 10 million people. </span>

	<span id="sent706">By 1922 there were 4.5 -7 million homeless children in Russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from World War I, the Russian Civil War, and the subsequent famine of 1920 -1922. </span>

	<span id="sent707">Considerable numbers of anti-Soviet Russians fled the country after the Revolution; by the 1930s the northern Chinese city of Harbin had 100,000 Russians.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent708">Lobbying by Chaim Weizmann and fear that American Jews would encourage the USA to support Germany culminated in the Balfour Declaration of 1917 by the British government. </span>

	<span id="sent709">This endorsed the creation of a Jewish Homeland in Palestine. </span>

	<span id="sent710">Over 1,172,000 Jewish soldiers served in the Allied and Central Power forces in World War I, including 450,000 in Czarist Russia and 275,000 in Austria-Hungary. </span>

	<span id="sent711">Over 2000 pogroms accompanied the Revolution of 1917 and the ensuing Russian Civil War, 60,000 -200,000 civilian Jews were killed in the atrocities throughout the former Russian Empire. </span>

	<span id="sent712">Most of the pogroms occurred in the Ukraine.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent713">In the aftermath of World War I, Greece fought against Turkish nationalists led by Mustafa Kemal, a war which resulted in a massive population exchange between the two countries under the Treaty of Lausanne. </span>

	<span id="sent714">According to various sources, several hundred thousand Pontic Greeks died during this period.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent715">Peace treaties.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent716">After the war, the Paris Peace Conference imposed a series of peace treaties on the Central Powers. </span>

	<span id="sent717">The 1919 Treaty of Versailles officially ended the war. </span>

	<span id="sent718">Building on Wilson's 14th point, the Treaty of Versailles also brought into being the League of Nations on 28 June 1919.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent719">In signing the treaty, Germany acknowledged responsibility for the war, agreeing to pay enormous war reparations and award territory to the victors. </span>

	<span id="sent720">The ``Guilt Thesis'' became a controversial explanation of events in Britain and the United States. </span>

	<span id="sent721">The Treaty of Versailles caused enormous bitterness in Germany, which nationalist movements, especially the Nazis, exploited with a conspiracy theory they called the Dolchstosslegende ( Stab-in-the-back legend). </span>

	<span id="sent722">The Weimar Republic lost the former colonial possessions and was saddled with accepting blame for the war, as well as paying punitive reparations for it. </span>

	<span id="sent723">Unable to pay them with exports (a result of territorial losses and postwar recession), Germany did so by borrowing from the United States, until runaway inflation in the 1920s, contributed to the economic collapse of the Weimar Republic. </span>

	<span id="sent724">The reparations were suspended in 1931.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent725">Austria -Hungary was also partitioned, largely but not entirely along ethnic lines, into several successor states including Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, as well as adding Transylvania from Hungary to the Greater Romania. </span>

	<span id="sent726">The details were contained in the Treaty of Saint-Germain and the Treaty of Trianon. </span>

	<span id="sent727">As a result of the Treaty of Trianon 3.3 million Hungarians came under foreign rule. </span>

	<span id="sent728">Although the Hungarians made up 54% of the population of the pre-war Kingdom of Hungary, only 32% of its territory was left to Hungary. </span>

	<span id="sent729">Between 1920 and 1924, 354,000 Hungarians fled former Hungarian territories attached to Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent730">The Russian Empire, which had withdrawn from the war in 1917 after the October Revolution, lost much of its western frontier as the newly independent nations of Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland were carved from it; Bessarabia was also re-attached to the Greater Romania as it had been a Romanian territory for more than a thousand years.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent731">The Ottoman Empire disintegrated, and much of its non-Anatolian territory was awarded as protectorates of various Allied powers, while the remaining Turkish core was reorganized as the Republic of Turkey. </span>

	<span id="sent732">The Ottoman Empire was to be partitioned by the Treaty of Sevres in 1920. </span>

	<span id="sent733">This treaty was never ratified by the Sultan and was rejected by the Turkish republican movement, leading to the Turkish Independence War and, ultimately, to the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent734">Legacy.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent735">The first tentative efforts to comprehend the meaning and consequences of modern warfare began during the initial phases of the war, and this process continued throughout and after the end of hostilities.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent736">Memorials.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent737">Memorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns. </span>

	<span id="sent738">Close to battlefields, the improvised burial grounds were gradually moved to formal graveyards under the care of organisations such as the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the American Battle Monuments Commission, the German War Graves Commission and Le Souvenir francais. </span>

	<span id="sent739">Many of these graveyards also have central monuments to the missing or unidentified dead, such as the Menin Gate memorial and the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent740">On 3 May 1915, during the Second Battle of Ypres, Lieutenant Alexis Helmer was killed. </span>

	<span id="sent741">At his graveside, his friend John McCrae, M.D., of Guelph, Ontario, Canada wrote the memorable poem In Flanders Fields as a salute to those who perished in the Great War. </span>

	<span id="sent742">Published in Punch on 8 December 1915, it is still recited today, especially on Remembrance Day and Memorial Day.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent743">Use of memory.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent744">The First World War had a lasting impact on social memory. </span>

	<span id="sent745">It was seen by many in the United Kingdom as signalling the end of Victorian England, and across Europe many regarded it as a watershed moment. </span>

	<span id="sent746">Over time, the memory of the First World War has, historians have argued, become a self-perpetuating idea. </span>

	<span id="sent747">Samuel Hynes summed up the image thus:<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent748">``A generation of innocent young men, their heads full of high abstractions like Honour, Glory and England, went off to war to make the world safe for democracy. </span>

	<span id="sent749">They were slaughtered in stupid battles planned by stupid generals. </span>

	<span id="sent750">Those who survived were shocked, disillusioned and embittered by their war experiences, and saw that their real enemies were not the Germans, but the old men at home who had lied to them. they rejected the values of the society that had sent them to war, and in doing so separated their own generation fro the past and from their cultural inheritance.``<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent751">This has become the most common perception of the First World War, perpetuated by the art, cinema, poems and stories published subsequently. </span>

	<span id="sent752">Cinematography such as All Quiet on the Western Front, Paths of Glory and For King and Country have perpetuated the idea; while war-time films including Camrades, Flanders Poppies and Shoulder Arms indicate that the most contemporary views of the war were overall far more positive. </span>

	<span id="sent753">Likewise, the art of Paul Nash, John Nash, Christopher Nevison and Henry Tonks in Britain painted a negative view of the conflict in keeping with the growing perception, while popular war-time artists such as Muirhead Bone painted more serene and pleasant interpretations subsequently rejected as inaccurate. </span>

	<span id="sent754">Several historians have since countered these interpretations:<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent755">These beliefs did not become widely shared because they offered the only accurate interpretation of wartime events. </span>

	<span id="sent756">In every respect, the war was much more complicated than they suggest. </span>

	<span id="sent757">In recent years, historians have argued persuasively against almost every popular cliche of the First World War. </span>

	<span id="sent758">It has been pointed out that, although the losses were devastating, their greatest impact was socially and geographically limited. </span>

	<span id="sent759">The many emotions other than horror experienced by soldiers in and out of the front line, including comradeship, boredom and even enjoyment, have been recognized. </span>

	<span id="sent760">The war is not now seen as a 'fight about nothing', but as a war of ideals, a struggle between aggressive militarism and more or less liberal democracy. </span>

	<span id="sent761">It has been acknowledged that British generals were often capable men facing difficult challenges, and that it was under their command that the British army played a major part in the defeat of the Germans in 1918: a great forgotten victory.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent762">Though these historians have discounted as ``myths'' these perceptions of the war, they are nevertheless prevalent across much of society. </span>

	<span id="sent763">They have dynamically changed according to contemporary influences, reflecting in the 1950s perceptions of the war as 'aimless' following the contrasting Second World War, and emphasising conflict within the ranks during times of class conflict in the 1960s. </span>

	<span id="sent764">The majority of additions to the contrary are often rejected.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent765">Social trauma.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent766">The social trauma caused by unprecedented rates of casualties manifested itself in different ways, which have been the subject of subsequent historical debate. </span>

	<span id="sent767">Some people were revolted by nationalism and its results, and so they began to work toward a more internationalist world, supporting organisations such as the League of Nations. </span>

	<span id="sent768">Pacifism became increasingly popular. </span>

	<span id="sent769">Others had the opposite reaction, feeling that only strength and military might could be relied upon in a chaotic and inhumane world. </span>

	<span id="sent770">Anti-modernist views were an outgrowth of the many changes taking place in society.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent771">The experiences of the war led to a collective trauma shared by many from all participating countries. </span>

	<span id="sent772">The optimism of la belle epoque was destroyed and those who fought in the war were referred to as the Lost Generation. </span>

	<span id="sent773">For years afterwards, people mourned the dead, the missing, and the many disabled. </span>

	<span id="sent774">Many soldiers returned with severe trauma, suffering from shell shock (also called neurasthenia). </span>

	<span id="sent775">Many more returned home with few after-effects, however their silence contributed to the conflict's growing mythological status. </span>

	<span id="sent776">In the United Kingdom, mass-mobilisation, large casualty rates and the collapse of the Edwardian age made a strong impression on society. </span>

	<span id="sent777">Though many participants did not share in the experiences of combat or spend any significant time at the front, or had positive memories of their time in the war, the image of suffering and trauma became the normal perception. </span>

	<span id="sent778">Historians including Dan Todman, Paul Fussell and Samuel Heyns have all published works since the 1990s arguing that these common perceptions of the war are factually incorrect.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent779">The end of the war also set the stage for other world conflicts, some of which are continuing. </span>

	<span id="sent780">For instance, it enabled the rise of the Bolsheviks and the creation of the Soviet Union.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent781">Discontent in Germany.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent782">The rise of Nazism and fascism included a revival of the nationalist spirit and a rejection of many post-war changes. </span>

	<span id="sent783">Similarly, the popularity of the Stab-in-the-back legend (German: Dolchstosslegende) was a testament to the psychological state of defeated Germany and was a rejection of responsibility for the conflict. </span>

	<span id="sent784">This conspiracy theory of betrayal became common and the German public came to see themselves as victims. </span>

	<span id="sent785">The Dolchstosslegende's popular acceptance in Germany played a significant role in the rise of Nazism. </span>

	<span id="sent786">A sense of disillusionment and cynicism became pronounced, with nihilism growing in popularity. </span>

	<span id="sent787">This disillusionment for humanity found a cultural climax with the Dadaist artistic movement. </span>

	<span id="sent788">Many believed the war heralded the end of the world as they had known it, including the collapse of capitalism and imperialism. </span>

	<span id="sent789">Communist and socialist movements around the world drew strength from this theory and enjoyed a level of popularity they had never known before. </span>

	<span id="sent790">These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or harshly affected by the war. </span>

	<span id="sent791">Out of German discontent with the still controversial Treaty of Versailles, Adolf Hitler was able to gain popularity and power. </span>

	<span id="sent792">World War II was in part a continuation of the power struggle that was never fully resolved by the First World War; in fact, it was common for Germans in the 1930s and 1940s to justify acts of international aggression because of perceived injustices imposed by the victors of the First World War.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent793">The establishment of the modern state of Israel and the roots of the continuing Israeli-Palestinian Conflict are partially found in the unstable power dynamics of the Middle East which were born at the end of World War I. Previous to the end of fighting in the war, the Ottoman Empire had maintained a modest level of peace and stability throughout the Middle East. </span>

	<span id="sent794">With the end of the war and the fall of Ottoman government, power vacuums developed and conflicting claims to land and nationhood began to emerge. </span>

	<span id="sent795">Sometimes after only cursory consultation with the local population, the political boundaries drawn by the victors of the First World War were quickly imposed, and in many cases are still problematic in the 21st century struggles for national identity. </span>

	<span id="sent796">While the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I was a pivotal milestone in the creation of the modern political situation of the Middle East, including especially the Arab-Israeli conflict, the end of Ottoman rule also spawned lesser known disputes over water and other natural resources.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent797">American views.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent798">U.S. intervention in the war, as well as the Wilson administration, became deeply unpopular and this was reflected in the rejection of the Versailles treaty and membership in the League of Nations by the U.S. Senate. </span>

	<span id="sent799">There was a strong consensus in the interwar era that U.S. intervention was a mistake, and laws were passed in an attempt to preserve U.S. neutrality in any future conflict. </span>

	<span id="sent800">Polls taken in 1937 and the opening months of World War II established that around 60% regarded the intervention as a mistake with only 28% opposing that view. </span>

	<span id="sent801">However, in the period between the fall of France and the attack on Pearl Harbor public opinion changed dramatically, and for the first time a narrow plurality rejected the idea that the war was a mistake.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent802">New national identities.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent803">Poland reemerged as an independent country, after more than a century. </span>

	<span id="sent804">As a ``minor Entente nation'' and the country with the largest casualties per head the Kingdom of Serbia and its dynasty became the backbone of the new multinational state, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed Yugoslavia). </span>

	<span id="sent805">Czechoslovakia became a new nation. </span>

	<span id="sent806">Russia became the Soviet Union and lost Finland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, which became independent countries. </span>

	<span id="sent807">The Ottoman Empire was soon replaced by Turkey and several other countries in the Middle East.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent808">In the British Empire, the war unleashed new forms of nationalism. </span>

	<span id="sent809">In Australia and New Zealand the Battle of Gallipoli became known as those nations' ``Baptism of Fire''. </span>

	<span id="sent810">It was the first major war in which the newly established countries fought and it was one of the first times that Australian troops fought as Australians, not just subjects of the British Crown. </span>

	<span id="sent811">Anzac Day, commemorating the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, celebrates this defining moment.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent812">After the Battle of Vimy Ridge, where the Canadian divisions fought together for the first time as a single corps, Canadians began to refer to theirs as a nation ``forged from fire''. </span>

	<span id="sent813">Having succeeded on the same battleground where the ``mother countries'' had previously faltered, they were for the first time respected internationally for their own accomplishments. </span>

	<span id="sent814">Canada entered the war as a Dominion of the British Empire and remained so afterwards, although she emerged with a greater measure of independence. </span>

	<span id="sent815">While the other Dominions were represented by Britain, Canada was an independent negotiator and signatory of the Versailles Treaty.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent816">Economic effects.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent817">One of the most dramatic effects of the war was the expansion of governmental powers and responsibilities in Britain, France, the United States, and the Dominions of the British Empire. </span>

	<span id="sent818">In order to harness all the power of their societies, new government ministries and powers were created. </span>

	<span id="sent819">New taxes were levied and laws enacted, all designed to bolster the war effort; many of which have lasted to this day. </span>

	<span id="sent820">Similarly, the war strained the abilities of the formerly large and bureaucratized governments such as in Austria -Hungary and Germany; however, any analysis of the long-term effects were clouded by the defeat of these governments.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent821">Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased for three Allies (Britain, Italy, and U.S.), but decreased in France and Russia, in neutral Netherlands, and in the main three Central Powers. </span>

	<span id="sent822">The shrinkage in GDP in Austria, Russia, France, and the Ottoman Empire reached 30 to 40%. </span>

	<span id="sent823">In Austria, for example, most of the pigs were slaughtered and, at war's end, there was no meat.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent824">All nations had increases in the government's share of GDP, surpassing fifty percent in both Germany and France and nearly reaching fifty percent in Britain. </span>

	<span id="sent825">To pay for purchases in the United States, Britain cashed in its extensive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing heavily on Wall Street. </span>

	<span id="sent826">President Wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916, but allowed a great increase in U.S. government lending to the Allies. </span>

	<span id="sent827">After 1919, the U.S. demanded repayment of these loans, which, in part, were funded by German reparations, which, in turn, were supported by American loans to Germany. </span>

	<span id="sent828">This circular system collapsed in 1931 and the loans were never repaid. </span>

	<span id="sent829">In 1934, Britain owed the US $4.4 billion of World War I debt.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent830">Macro-and micro-economic consequences devolved from the war. </span>

	<span id="sent831">Families were altered by the departure of many men. </span>

	<span id="sent832">With the death or absence of the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers. </span>

	<span id="sent833">At the same time, industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war. </span>

	<span id="sent834">This aided the struggle for voting rights for women.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent835">In Britain, rationing was finally imposed in early 1918, limited to meat, sugar, and fats (butter and oleo), but not bread. </span>

	<span id="sent836">The new system worked smoothly. </span>

	<span id="sent837">From 1914 to 1918 trade union membership doubled, from a little over four million to a little over eight million. </span>

	<span id="sent838">Work stoppages and strikes became frequent in 1917 -1918 as the unions expressed grievances regarding prices, alcohol control, pay disputes, fatigue from overtime and working on Sundays and inadequate housing.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent839">Britain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war materials whose supply had become difficult from traditional sources. </span>

	<span id="sent840">Geologists such as Albert Ernest Kitson were called upon to find new resources of precious minerals in the African colonies. </span>

	<span id="sent841">Kitson discovered important new deposits of manganese, used in munitions production, in the Gold Coast.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent842">Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles (the so-called ``war guilt'' clause) declared Germany and its allies responsible for all ``loss and damage'' suffered by the Allies during the war and provided the basis for reparations. </span>

	<span id="sent843">The total reparations demanded was 132 billion gold marks which was far more than the total German gold or foreign exchange. </span>

	<span id="sent844">The economic problems that the payments brought, and German resentment at their imposition, are usually cited as one of the more significant factors that led to the end of the Weimar Republic and the beginning of the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler. </span>

	<span id="sent845">After Germany's defeat in World War II, payment of the reparations was not resumed. </span>

	<span id="sent846">There was, however, outstanding German debt that the Weimar Republic had used to pay the reparations. </span>

	<span id="sent847">Germany will finish paying off the Americans in 2010 and the rest in 2020.
