	<span id="sent0">Dublin ( /  d  b l  n /; locally /  d  b l n / or /  d  b l n /; Irish: Baile Atha Cliath, pronounced [bal aha klih] or Ath Cliath, [ah cli()]) is the largest city in Ireland and the capital city of the Republic of Ireland. </span>

	<span id="sent1">The English name is derived from the Irish name Dubh Linn, meaning ``black pool''. </span>

	<span id="sent2">It is a primate city with a population of 506,211, and an urban population of over 1 million, containing almost 25% of the country's population. </span>

	<span id="sent3">Dublin is situated near the midpoint of Ireland's east coast, at the mouth of the River Liffey, and at the centre of the Dublin Region.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent4">Originally founded as a Viking settlement, it evolved into the Kingdom of Dublin and became the island's primary city following the Norman invasion. </span>

	<span id="sent5">The city expanded rapidly from the 17th century, and for a brief period was the second largest city within the British Empire and the fifth largest in Europe. </span>

	<span id="sent6">After the Act of Union in 1801, Dublin entered a period of stagnation, but remained the economic centre for most of the island. </span>

	<span id="sent7">Following the partition of Ireland in 1922, the new parliament, the Oireachtas, was located in Leinster House. </span>

	<span id="sent8">Dublin became the capital of the Irish Free State and later of the Republic of Ireland.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent9">Similar to the other cities of Cork, Limerick, Galway, and Waterford, Dublin is administered separately from its respective county and has its own city council. </span>

	<span id="sent10">The city is currently ranked 29th in the Global Financial Centres Index and is listed by the GaWC as a global city, with a ranking of Alpha, placing Dublin among the top 30 cities in the world. </span>

	<span id="sent11">It is a historical and contemporary cultural centre for the country, as well as a modern centre of education, the arts, administration, economy and industry.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent12">Etymology.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent13">The name Dublin is derived from the Irish name Dubh Linn, meaning ``black pool''. </span>

	<span id="sent14">The common name for the city in modern Irish is Baile Atha Cliath, meaning ``town of the hurdled ford''. </span>

	<span id="sent15">Ath Cliath is a place name referring to a fording point of the River Liffey in the vicinity of Father Mathew Bridge (Church Street). </span>

	<span id="sent16">Baile Atha Cliath was an early Christian monastery which is believed to have been situated in the area of Aungier Street currently occupied by Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent17">The settlement or site was also called Ath Cliath Cualann in the Prose Dindsenchas and was a major point on the Slighe-Cualann, or highway that passed from Meath to the state of Cuala in southern County Dublin.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent18">The subsequent Scandinavian settlement was on the River Poddle, a tributary of the Liffey, to the east of Christchurch, in an area now known as Wood Quay. </span>

	<span id="sent19">The Dubh Linn was a lake used by the Scandinavians to moor their ships and was connected to the Liffey by the Poddle. </span>

	<span id="sent20">These lakes were covered during the early 18th century, and as the city expanded they were largely forgotten about. </span>

	<span id="sent21">The Dubh Linn was situated where the Castle Garden is now located, opposite the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin Castle. </span>

	<span id="sent22">Tain Bo Cuailgne also known as The Cattle Raid of Cooley refers to Dublind rissa ratter Ath Cliath, meaning Dublin, which is called Ath Cliath. </span>

	<span id="sent23">In Irish (except in Ulster Irish), Dubh is correctly pronounced as Du v or Du f. </span>

	<span id="sent24">The city's original pronunciation is preserved in Old Norse as Dy flin, Old English as Di felin, and modern Manx as Di vlyn. </span>

	<span id="sent25">Historically, in the Gaelic script, bh was written with a dot over the b, rendering ' Dub Linn' or ' Dublinn'. </span>

	<span id="sent26">Those without a knowledge of Irish omitted the dot and spelled the name as Dublin.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent27">History.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent28">The writings of the Greek astronomer and cartographer Ptolemy provide perhaps the earliest reference to human habitation in the area now known as Dublin. </span>

	<span id="sent29">In around AD 140 he referred to a settlement he called Eblana Civitas. </span>

	<span id="sent30">The settlement 'Dubh Linn' dates perhaps as far back as the 1st century BC and later a monastery was built there, though the town was established in about 841 by the Norse. </span>

	<span id="sent31">The modern city retains the Anglicised Irish name of the former and the original Irish name of the latter.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent32">Dublin was ruled by the Norse for most of the time between 841 and 999, when it was sacked by Brian Boru, the King of Cashel. </span>

	<span id="sent33">Although Dublin still had a Norse king after the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, Norse influence waned under a growing Celtic supremacy until the Norman invasion of Ireland which was launched from Wales in 1169-1172. </span>

	<span id="sent34">The last high king (Ard Ri) of Dublin also had local city administration via its Corporation from the Middle Ages. </span>

	<span id="sent35">This represented the city's guild-based oligarchy until it was reformed in the 1840s on increasingly democratic lines. </span>

	<span id="sent36">In 1348, the city was hit by the Black Death, a lethal plague that ravaged Europe in the mid-14th century.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent37">From the 17th century the city expanded rapidly, helped by the Wide Streets Commission. </span>

	<span id="sent38">The population grew from about 10,000 in 1600 to over 50,000 in 1700, and this in spite of another plague epidemic in 1649-51. </span>

	<span id="sent39">Georgian Dublin was, for a short time, the second city of the British Empire after London and the fifth largest European city. </span>

	<span id="sent40">Much of Dublin's most notable architecture dates from this time. </span>

	<span id="sent41">In 1759, the founding of the Guinness brewery at St. James's Gate resulted in a considerable economic impact for the city. </span>

	<span id="sent42">For much of the time since its foundation, the Guinness brewery was the largest employer in the city but Catholics were confined to the lower echelons of employment at Guinness and only entered management level in the 1960s. </span>

	<span id="sent43">After Irish independence the Guinness Corporate headquarters were moved to London in the 1930s to avoid Irish taxation and a rival brewery to Dublin was opened in London at Park Royal to supply the UK. </span>

	<span id="sent44">In 1742 Handel's `` Messiah'' was performed for the first time in New Musick Hall in Fishamble Street with 26 boys and five men from the combined choirs of St.Patrick's and Christ Church cathedrals participating.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent45">After the Act of Union, 1800, the seat of government moved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in London. </span>

	<span id="sent46">Dublin entered a period of decline, but remained the centre of administration and a transport hub for much of Ireland. </span>

	<span id="sent47">Dublin played no major role in the Industrial Revolution. </span>

	<span id="sent48">Ireland had no significant sources of coal, the fuel of the time, and Dublin was not a centre of ship manufacture, the other main driver of industrial development in Britain and Ireland. </span>

	<span id="sent49">Belfast developed faster than Dublin during this period on a mixture of international trade, factory-based linen cloth production and shipbuilding.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent50">The Easter Rising of 1916, the War of Independence ( Anglo-Irish War), and Irish Civil War resulted in a significant amount of physical destruction in the city centre. </span>

	<span id="sent51">The Government of the Irish Free State rebuilt the city centre and located the new Oireachtas (Parliament) in Leinster House. </span>

	<span id="sent52">Since the beginning of Anglo-Norman rule in the 12th century, the city has functioned as the capital in varying geopolitical entities: Lordship of Ireland (1171 -1541), Kingdom of Ireland (1541 -1800), island as part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1801 -1922), and the Irish Republic (1919 -1922). </span>

	<span id="sent53">From 1922, following the partition of Ireland, it became the capital of the Irish Free State (1922 -1949) and now is the capital of the Republic of Ireland. </span>

	<span id="sent54">One of the memorials to commemorate that time is the Garden of Remembrance.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent55">Since 1997, the landscape of Dublin has changed immensely, with enormous private sector and state development of housing, transport, and business. </span>

	<span id="sent56">(see also Development and Preservation in Dublin). </span>

	<span id="sent57">Some well-known Dublin street corners are still named for the pub or business which used to occupy the site before closure or redevelopment.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent58">Government.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent59">Local.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent60">Dublin City Council is presided over by the Lord Mayor, who is elected for a yearly term. </span>

	<span id="sent61">Council meetings occur at Dublin City Hall, while most of its administrative activities are based in the Civic Offices on Wood Quay. </span>

	<span id="sent62">The council is a unicameral assembly of 52 members, elected every five years from Local Election Areas. </span>

	<span id="sent63">The party, or coalition of parties, with the majority of seats adjudicates committee members, introduces policies, and appoints the Lord Mayor. </span>

	<span id="sent64">Chaired by the Lord Mayor, the Council passes an annual budget for spending on housing, traffic management, refuse, drainage, planning, etc. </span>

	<span id="sent65">The Dublin City Manager is responsible for implementing City Council decisions.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent66">The current Lord Mayor is Cllr. </span>

	<span id="sent67">Gerry Breen. </span>

	<span id="sent68">In 2008, the Government announced plans for local government reform, involving plans for an elected Mayor of Dublin with executive powers. </span>

	<span id="sent69">The Environment Minister John Gormley said that the new mayor would make local government services more efficient for the capital's inhabitants. </span>

	<span id="sent70">The plan also included local plebiscites, petition rights, participatory budgeting and city meetings. </span>

	<span id="sent71">Although a bill to bring about the changes was published in October 2010, the legislation had not completed its passage through the Oireachtas when the Green Party left the government, leading to a general election in early 2011.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent72">National.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent73">The Oireachtas is the national parliament of Ireland and is based in Dublin. </span>

	<span id="sent74">It comprises the President of Ireland, the upper house Seanad Eireann (Senate), and the lower house Dail Eireann (House of Representatives). </span>

	<span id="sent75">The President resides in Aras an Uachtarain in the Phoenix Park. </span>

	<span id="sent76">Both houses of the Oireachtas meet in Leinster House, a former ducal palace on Kildare Street. </span>

	<span id="sent77">It has been the home of the Irish parliament since the creation of the Irish Free State. </span>

	<span id="sent78">The old Irish Houses of Parliament of the Kingdom of Ireland are in College Green.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent79">Government Buildings house the Department of the Taoiseach, the Council Chamber, the Department of Finance and the Office of the Attorney General. </span>

	<span id="sent80">It consists of a main building (completed 1911) with two wings (completed 1921) and was designed by Thomas Manley Dean and Sir Aston Webb as the Royal College of Science. </span>

	<span id="sent81">In 1921 the House of Commons of Southern Ireland met here. </span>

	<span id="sent82">Given its location next to Leinster House, the Irish Free State government took over the two wings of the building to serve as a temporary home for some ministries, while the central building became the College of Technology until 1989. </span>

	<span id="sent83">Both it and Leinster House, intended to be temporary, became permanent homes of parliament.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent84">Geography.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent85">Landscape.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent86">Dublin is situated at the mouth of the River Liffey and encompasses a land area of approximately 115km . </span>

	<span id="sent87">It is bordered by a low mountain range to the south and surrounded by flat farmland to the north and west. </span>

	<span id="sent88">A north-south division has traditionally existed, with the River Liffey as the divider. </span>

	<span id="sent89">The Northside is generally seen as working-class, while the Southside is seen as middle to upper middle class. </span>

	<span id="sent90">The divide is punctuated by examples of Dublin ``sub-culture'' stereotypes, with upper-middle class constituents seen as tending towards an accent and demeanour synonymous with the Southside, and working-class Dubliners seen as tending towards characteristics associated with Northside and inner-city areas. </span>

	<span id="sent91">Dublin's economic divide is east-west as well as north-south. </span>

	<span id="sent92">There are also social divisions evident between the coastal suburbs in the east of the city, including those on the northside, and the newer developments further to the west.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent93">Climate.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent94">Dublin experiences a maritime temperate climate with mild winters, cool summers, and a lack of temperature extremes. </span>

	<span id="sent95">The average maximum January temperature is 8.3C (47F), while the average maximum July temperature is 19.6C (67F). </span>

	<span id="sent96">On average, the sunniest months are May and June, while the wettest month is December with 73mm (3in) of rain, and the driest month is July with 43mm (2in). </span>

	<span id="sent97">Rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent98">Dublin records the least amount of rainfall in Ireland, with the average annual precipitation in the city centre being 695mm (27in). </span>

	<span id="sent99">The main precipitation in winter is rain, however snow showers do occur between November and March. </span>

	<span id="sent100">Hail is more common than snow, and is most likely during the winter and spring months. </span>

	<span id="sent101">The city experiences long summer days and short winter days. </span>

	<span id="sent102">Strong Atlantic winds are most common in autumn. </span>

	<span id="sent103">These winds can affect Dublin, but due to its easterly location it is least affected compared to other parts of the country.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent104">Places of interest.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent105">Landmarks.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent106">Dublin has many landmarks and monuments dating back hundreds of years. </span>

	<span id="sent107">One of the oldest is Dublin Castle, which was first founded as a major defensive work on the orders of King John of England in 1204, shortly after the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169, when it was commanded that a castle be built with strong walls and good ditches for the defence of the city, the administration of justice, and the protection of the King's treasure. </span>

	<span id="sent108">Largely complete by 1230, the castle was of typical Norman courtyard design, with a central square without a keep, bounded on all sides by tall defensive walls and protected at each corner by a circular tower. </span>

	<span id="sent109">Sited to the south-east of Norman Dublin, the castle formed one corner of the outer perimeter of the city, using the River Poddle as a natural means of defence.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent110">One of Dublin's newest monuments is the Spire of Dublin, or officially titled ``Monument of Light''. </span>

	<span id="sent111">It is a 121.2metres (398ft) conical spire made of stainless steel and is located on O'Connell Street. </span>

	<span id="sent112">It replaces Nelson's Pillar and is intended to mark Dublin's place in the 21st century. </span>

	<span id="sent113">The spire was designed by Ian Ritchie Architects, who sought an ``Elegant and dynamic simplicity bridging art and technology''. </span>

	<span id="sent114">During the day it maintains its steel look, but at dusk the monument appears to merge into the sky. </span>

	<span id="sent115">The base of the monument is lit and the top is illuminated to provide a beacon in the night sky across the city. </span>

	<span id="sent116">Other popular landmarks and monuments include the Mansion House, the Anna Livia monument, the Molly Malone statue, Christ Church Cathedral, St Patrick's Cathedral, and Aras an Uachtarain.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent117">Parks.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent118">Dublin has more green spaces per square kilometre than any other European capital city, with 97% of city residents living within 300 meters of a park area. </span>

	<span id="sent119">The city council provides 2.96hectares (7.3acres) of public green space per 1,000 people and 255 playing fields. </span>

	<span id="sent120">The council also plants approximately 5,000 trees annually and manages over 1,500hectares (3,700 acres) of parks.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent121">There are many park areas around the city, including the Phoenix Park, Herbert Park and St Stephen's Green. </span>

	<span id="sent122">The Phoenix Park is 2 -4km west of the city centre, north of the River Liffey. </span>

	<span id="sent123">Its 16km perimeter wall encloses 707hectares (1,750 acres) one of the largest walled city parks in Europe. </span>

	<span id="sent124">It includes large areas of grassland and tree-lined avenues, and since the 17th century has been home to a herd of wild Fallow deer. </span>

	<span id="sent125">The residence of the President of Ireland (Aras an Uachtarain), which was built in 1754, is located in the park. </span>

	<span id="sent126">The park is also home to Dublin Zoo, the official residence of the United States Ambassador, and Ashtown Castle. </span>

	<span id="sent127">Music concerts have also been performed in the park by many singers and musicians.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent128">St Stephen's Green is adjacent to one of Dublin's main shopping streets, Grafton Street, and to a shopping centre named for it, while on its surrounding streets are the offices of a number of public bodies and the city terminus of one of Dublin's Luas tram lines. </span>

	<span id="sent129">St Anne's Park is a public park and recreational facility, shared between Raheny and Clontarf, both suburbs on the North Side of Dublin. </span>

	<span id="sent130">The park, the second largest municipal park in Dublin, is part of a former 2km (500 acre) estate assembled by members of the Guinness family, beginning with Benjamin Lee Guinness in 1835 (the largest municipal park is nearby (North) Bull Island, also shared between Clontarf and Raheny).<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent131">Economy.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent132">Dublin has been at the centre of Ireland's phenomenal economic growth over the last decade (known as the Celtic Tiger period) and subsequent contraction. </span>

	<span id="sent133">In 2009, Dublin was listed as the fourth-richest city in the world, and according to one source, is the world's 25th most expensive city. </span>

	<span id="sent134">It is also listed as the tenth most expensive city in the world in which to live. </span>

	<span id="sent135">However, it had the second highest wages for a city in the world, ahead of both New York City and London, though behind Zurich but as of 2009 has dropped to tenth highest. </span>

	<span id="sent136">In 2005, around 800,000 people were employed in the Greater Dublin Area, of whom around 600,000 were employed in the services sector and 200,000 in the industrial sector.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent137">Guinness has been brewed at the St. James's Gate Brewery since 1759. </span>

	<span id="sent138">Since the advent of the Celtic Tiger years, however, a large number of global pharmaceutical, information and communications technology companies have located in Dublin and the Greater Dublin Area. </span>

	<span id="sent139">For example, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, eBay, PayPal, Yahoo!, Facebook and Pfizer (among others) now have European headquarters and/or operational bases in the city. </span>

	<span id="sent140">Intel and Hewlett-Packard have large manufacturing plants in Leixlip, County Kildare, 15km (9mi) to the west.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent141">Banking, finance and commerce are also important in the city. </span>

	<span id="sent142">There are currently more than 430 financial operations allowed to trade within the International Financial Services Centre. </span>

	<span id="sent143">According to the official website it is home to more than half of the world's 50 largest banks. </span>

	<span id="sent144">Many international firms have established major headquarters in the city, such as Citibank and Commerzbank. </span>

	<span id="sent145">Also located in Dublin is the Irish Stock Exchange (ISEQ), Internet Neutral Exchange (INEX) and Irish Enterprise Exchange (IEX). </span>

	<span id="sent146">The economic boom led to a sharp increase in construction, with large redevelopment projects such as the Dublin Docklands and Spencer Dock. </span>

	<span id="sent147">Completed projects include the Convention Centre, The O 2, and the Grand Canal Theatre. </span>

	<span id="sent148">Proposed projects such as the Point Village Watchtower, Heuston Gate, and U2 Tower, are currently delayed due to the difficult economic climate.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent149">Transport.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent150">Dublin is the main hub of the country's road network. </span>

	<span id="sent151">The M50 motorway, a semi-ring road which runs around the south, west and north of the city, connects important national primary routes in the state to the regions. </span>

	<span id="sent152">As of 2008, a toll of 2 applies on the West-Link, two adjacent bridges that tower above the River Liffey near the town of Lucan. </span>

	<span id="sent153">The West-Link Toll Bridge was replaced by the eFlow barrier-free tolling system in August 2008, with a three-tiered charge system based on electronic tags and car pre-registration.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent154">To complete the ring road, an eastern bypass is also proposed for the city of Dublin. </span>

	<span id="sent155">The first half of this project is the Dublin Port Tunnel which opened in late 2006 and mainly caters to heavy vehicles. </span>

	<span id="sent156">The plan to build the eastern bypass around Dublin has been effectively shelved by the Department of Transport as there are no funds available for the expected 1 billion project. </span>

	<span id="sent157">The capital is also surrounded by an inner and outer orbital route. </span>

	<span id="sent158">The inner orbital route runs roughly around the heart of the Georgian city and the outer orbital route runs largely along the natural circle formed by Dublin's two canals, the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal, as well as the North and South Circular Roads.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent159">Dublin is served by an extensive network of nearly 200 bus routes which serve all areas of the city and suburbs. </span>

	<span id="sent160">The majority of these are controlled by Dublin Bus ( Bus Atha Cliath), but a number of smaller companies also operate. </span>

	<span id="sent161">Fares are generally calculated on a stage system based on distance travelled. </span>

	<span id="sent162">There are several different levels of fares, which apply on most services. </span>

	<span id="sent163">Certain routes (particularly Xpresso) use a different fare system. </span>

	<span id="sent164">The Dublin Suburban Rail network is a system of five rail lines serving mainly commuters in the Greater Dublin Area, though some trains go even further to commuter towns such as Drogheda and Dundalk. </span>

	<span id="sent165">One of these is an electrified line that runs along Dublin Bay and is known as the Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) line. </span>

	<span id="sent166">A two-line light rail/ tram network called the Luas opened in 2004 and has proved popular in the areas it serves. </span>

	<span id="sent167">Five new luas lines are planned, the last of which will be opened in 2014, with the two existing lines set to be joined up by 2012.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent168">There are plans to begin building work on the Dublin Metro (subway / underground) system set out in the Irish government's 2005 Transport 21 plan within the next few years. </span>

	<span id="sent169">Although not confirmed, it is believed that the metro will be fully segregated from all traffic which will mean it will not disrupt traffic when in operation, unlike an on-street Luas tram or the DART. </span>

	<span id="sent170">The Metro North will bring rail access to areas and institutions currently lacking it, such as the Mater Hospital, Drumcondra ( Croke Park, inter-city and suburban rail stop), Dublin City University, Ballymun, Swords and Dublin Airport. </span>

	<span id="sent171">The Metro West will serve the large suburbs of Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent172">Dublin Bikes is a public bicycle rental scheme which has been operated in the city of Dublin since 2009. </span>

	<span id="sent173">The scheme uses 450 French-made unisex bicycles with a silver colour. </span>

	<span id="sent174">Dublin was the 17th city to begin using this scheme (predecessors include Copenhagen, Lyon, and Paris), though Dublin City Council suggested the Dublin launch was better. </span>

	<span id="sent175">The scheme is sponsored by JCDecaux.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent176">A car sharing scheme commenced service during summer 2010. </span>

	<span id="sent177">Several bases are planned around the city, Pleasants Street, off Camden Street, is the first in operation. </span>

	<span id="sent178">The service is managed with the support of the council by Mendes GoCar based in Cloughjordan.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent179">Education.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent180">Dublin is the primary centre of education in Ireland, with three universities and many other higher education institutions. </span>

	<span id="sent181">There are 20 third-level institutes in the city. </span>

	<span id="sent182">Dublin will be European Capital of Science in 2012. </span>

	<span id="sent183">The University of Dublin is the oldest university in Ireland dating from the 16th century, and is located in the city centre. </span>

	<span id="sent184">Its sole constituent college, Trinity College, was established by Royal Charter in 1592 under Elizabeth I and was closed to Roman Catholics until Catholic Emancipation. </span>

	<span id="sent185">The Catholic hierarchy then banned Roman Catholics from attending it until 1970. </span>

	<span id="sent186">It is situated in the city centre, on College Green, and has 15,000 students.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent208">The City of Dublin is the area administered by Dublin City Council, but the term ``Dublin'' normally refers to the contiguous urban area which includes parts of the adjacent local authority areas of Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin. </span>

	<span id="sent209">Together, the four areas form the traditional County Dublin. </span>

	<span id="sent210">This area is sometimes known as the Dublin Region. </span>

	<span id="sent211">The population of the administrative area controlled by the City Council was 505,739 in the 2006 census, while the population of the urban area was 1,045,769. </span>

	<span id="sent229">The best known theatres include the Gaiety, Abbey, Olympia, Gate, and Grand Canal. </span>

	<span id="sent231">The Abbey was founded in 1904 by a group that included Yeats with the aim of promoting indigenous literary talent. </span>

	<span id="sent252">Dublin has a vibrant nightlife and is reputedly one of Europe's most youthful cities, with an estimate of 50% of citizens being younger than 25. </span>

	<span id="sent253">There are many pubs across the city centre, with the area around St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street, especially Harcourt Street, Camden Street, Wexford Street and Leeson Street, having the most popular nightclubs and pubs.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent255">To some extent, the area has become popular among tourists, including stag and hen parties from Britain. </span>

	<span id="sent256">It was developed as Dublin's cultural quarter and does retain this spirit as a centre for small arts productions, photographic and artists' studios, and in the form of street performers and small music venues. </span>

	<span id="sent257">However, it has been criticised as overpriced, false and dirty by Lonely Planet. </span>

	<span id="sent258">In general, it is regarded by locals as tourist orientated with false ``ye olde Irish'' pretensions. </span>

	<span id="sent259">The areas around Leeson Street, Harcourt Street, South William Street and Camden/George's Street are popular nightlife spots for locals.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent260">Live music is popularly played on streets and at venues throughout Dublin in general, and the city has produced several musicians and groups of international success, including U2, Westlife, The Dubliners, The Thrills, Horslips, The Boomtown Rats, Boyzone, Ronan Keating, Thin Lizzy, Paddy Casey, Sinead O'Connor, The Script and My Bloody Valentine. </span>

	<span id="sent270">Dublin is also the location of large department stores, such as Clerys on O'Connell Street, and Arnotts on Henry Street.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent271">A major 800m development for the city centre, known as the ``Northern Quarter'' is currently in doubt. </span>

	<span id="sent272">It involved the construction of 47 new shops, 175 apartments and a four-star hotel. </span>

	<span id="sent273">Dublin City Council gave Arnotts planning permission for the plans to change the area bounded by Henry Street, O'Connell Street, Liffey Street and Abbey Street. </span>

	<span id="sent274">Following appeals to An Bord Pleanala, the extensive scale of the development was reduced. </span>

	<span id="sent275">Prince's Street, which runs off O'Connell Street, was to become a full urban street and pedestrian thoroughfare. </span>

	<span id="sent276">In July 2010 the project was effectively abandoned as Anglo Irish Bank and Ulster Bank took control of Arnotts due to the large debts incurred in pursuing the development. </span>

	<span id="sent277">The Carlton cinema site further up O'Connell Street is currently undergoing redevelopment by Crossidge Developments, who were responsible for the construction of Dundrum Town Centre, and will be anchored by British department store John Lewis.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent278">The city retains a thriving market culture, despite new shopping developments and the loss of some traditional market sites. </span>
