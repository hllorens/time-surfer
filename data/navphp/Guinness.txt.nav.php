	<span id="sent0">Guinness ( /    n  s / GIN-is) is a popular Irish dry stout that originated in the brewery of Arthur Guinness (1725 -1803) at St. James's Gate, Dublin. </span>

	<span id="sent1">Guinness is directly descended from the porter style that originated in London in the early 18th century and is one of the most successful beer brands worldwide.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent2">A distinctive feature is the burnt flavour which is derived from the use of roasted unmalted barley (though this is a relatively modern development since it did not become a part of the grist until well into the 20th century). </span>

	<span id="sent3">For many years a portion of aged brew was blended with freshly brewed product to give a sharp lactic flavour (which was a characteristic of the original Porter).<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent4">Although the palate of Guinness still features a characteristic ``tang'', the company has refused to confirm whether this type of blending still occurs. </span>

	<span id="sent5">The thick creamy head is the result of the beer being mixed with nitrogen when being poured. </span>

	<span id="sent6">It is popular with Irish people both in Ireland and abroad and, in spite of a decline in consumption since 2001 , is still the best-selling alcoholic drink in Ireland where Guinness & Co. makes almost 2 billion annually.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent7">The company had its headquarters in London from 1932 onwards. </span>

	<span id="sent8">It merged with Grand Metropolitan plc in 1997 and then figured in the development of the multi-national alcohol conglomerate Diageo.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent9">History.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent10">Arthur Guinness started brewing ales from 1759 at the St. James's Gate Brewery, Dublin. </span>

	<span id="sent11">On 31 December he signed (up to) a 9,000 year lease at 45 per annum for the unused brewery. </span>

	<span id="sent12">Ten years later on 19 May 1769 Guinness exported his ale for the first time, when six and a half barrels were shipped to England.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent13">Guinness is sometimes believed to have invented stout, however the first known use of the word stout in relation to beer appears in a letter in the Egerton Manuscript dated 1677, almost 50 years before Arthur Guinness was born. </span>

	<span id="sent14">``Stout'' originally referred to a beer's strength, but eventually shifted meaning toward body and colour.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent15">Arthur Guinness started selling the dark beer porter in 1778. </span>

	<span id="sent16">The first Guinness beers to use the term were Single Stout and Double Stout in the 1840s. </span>

	<span id="sent17">Throughout the bulk of its history, Guinness produced 'only three variations of a single beer type: porter or single stout, double or extra and foreign stout for export'.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent18">Already one of the top three British and Irish brewers, Guinness's sales soared from 350,000 barrels in 1868 to 779,000 barrels in 1876. </span>

	<span id="sent19">In October 1886 Guinness became a public company, and was averaging sales of 1,138,000 barrels a year. </span>

	<span id="sent20">This was despite Guinness' refusal to offer their beer at a discount and no advertising. </span>

	<span id="sent21">Even though Guinness owned no public houses, the company was valued at 6 million and shares were twenty times oversubscribed, with share prices rising to a 60% premium on the first day of trading.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent22">The breweries pioneered several quality control efforts. </span>

	<span id="sent23">The brewery hired the statistician William Sealy Gosset in 1899, who achieved lasting fame under the pseudonym ``Student'' for techniques developed for Guinness, particularly Student's t-distribution and the even more commonly known Student's t-test.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent24">By 1900 the brewery was operating unparalleled welfare schemes for its 5000 employees. </span>

	<span id="sent25">By 1907 the welfare schemes were costing the brewery 40,000 a year, which was one fifth of the total wages bill.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent26">By 1914, Guinness was producing 2,652,000 barrels of beer a year, which was more than double that of its nearest competitor Bass, and was supplying more than 10% of the total UK beer market.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent27">Guinness brewed their last porter in 1973.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent28">Guinness acquired the Distillers Company in 1986. </span>

	<span id="sent29">This led to a scandal over a 5.2 million kickback received during the takeover bid to one of the directors, Mr Ward, approved by the chairman, Mr Saunders. </span>

	<span id="sent30">In the case Guinness plc v Saunders the House of Lords declared that the payment had been invalid.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent31">The Company merged with Grand Metropolitan in 1997 to form Diageo plc. </span>

	<span id="sent32">However due to controversy over the merge in the same year, the Guinness co retained the rights to the product and all associated trademarks of Guinness, meaning that Guinness co. remained a corporation in its own right as well as being part of the merger that created Diageo. </span>

	<span id="sent33">The Guinness brewery in Park Royal, London closed in 2005. </span>

	<span id="sent34">The production of all Guinness sold in the UK and Ireland was switched to St. James's Gate Brewery, Dublin.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent35">Guinness has also been referred to as ``the black stuff'' and as a ``Pint of Plain'' -referred to in the famous refrain of Flann O'Brien's poem ``The Workman's Friend'': ``A pint of plain is your only man.''<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent36">Controversy over proposed sale of St James's Gate.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent37">The Sunday Independent reported on 17 June 2007 that Diageo intends closing the historic St James's Gate plant in Dublin and moving to a greenfield site on the outskirts of the city. </span>

	<span id="sent38">This news caused some controversy when it was announced.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent39">The following day, the Irish Daily Mail ran a follow-up story with a double page spread complete with images and a history of the plant since 1759. </span>

	<span id="sent40">Initially, Diageo said that talk of a move was pure speculation but in the face of mounting speculation in the wake of the Sunday Independent article, the company confirmed that it is undertaking a ``significant review of its operations''. </span>

	<span id="sent41">This review is largely due to the efforts of the company's ongoing drive to reduce the environmental impact of brewing at the St James's Gate plant.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent42">On 23 November 2007, an article appeared in the Evening Herald, a Dublin newspaper, stating that Dublin City Council, in the best interests of the city of Dublin, had put forward a motion to prevent planning permission ever being granted for development of the site thus making it very difficult for Diageo to sell off the site for residential development.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent43">On 9 May 2008, Diageo announced that the St James's Gate brewery will remain open and undergo renovations, but that breweries in Kilkenny and Dundalk will be closed by 2013 when a new larger brewery is opened near Dublin. </span>

	<span id="sent44">The result will be a loss of roughly 250 jobs across the entire Diageo/Guinness workforce in Ireland. </span>

	<span id="sent45">Two days later, the Sunday Independent again reported that Diageo chiefs had met with Tanaiste Mary Coughlan, the deputy leader of the Government of Ireland, about moving operations to Ireland from the UK to benefit from its lower corporation tax rates. </span>

	<span id="sent46">Several UK firms have made the move to pay Ireland's 12.5 percent rate rather than the UK's 28 percent rate. </span>

	<span id="sent47">Diageo released a statement to the London stock exchange denying the report. </span>

	<span id="sent48">Despite the merger that created Diageo plc in 1997, Guinness has retained its right to the Guinness brand and associated trademarks and thus continues to trade under the traditional Guinness name despite trading under the corporation name Diageo for a brief period in 1997.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent49">Composition.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent50">Guinness stout is made from water, barley, hops, and brewer's yeast, and is treated with isinglass finings made from fishes' air bladders, although Guinness has claimed that this finings material is unlikely to remain in the finished product. </span>

	<span id="sent51">A portion of the barley is roasted to give Guinness its dark colour and characteristic taste. </span>

	<span id="sent52">It is pasteurised and filtered. </span>

	<span id="sent53">Despite its reputation as a ``meal in a glass'', Guinness only contains 198 kcal (838 kilojoules) per imperial pint (1460 kJ/ l), fewer than skimmed milk or orange juice and most other non-light beers.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent54">Until the late 1950s Guinness was still racked into wooden casks. </span>

	<span id="sent55">It was in the late 1950s and early 1960s that aluminium kegs were replacing the wooden casks, these were nicknamed ``iron lungs''.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent56">Draught Guinness and its canned counterpart contain nitrogen (N 2) as well as carbon dioxide. </span>

	<span id="sent57">Nitrogen is less soluble than carbon dioxide, which allows the beer to be put under high pressure without making it fizzy. </span>

	<span id="sent58">The high pressure of dissolved gas is required to enable very small bubbles to be formed by forcing the draught beer through fine holes in a plate in the tap, which causes the characteristic ``surge'' (the widget in cans and bottles achieves the same effect). </span>

	<span id="sent59">The perceived smoothness of draught Guinness is due to its low level of carbon dioxide and the creaminess of the head caused by the very fine bubbles that arise from the use of nitrogen and the dispensing method described above. </span>

	<span id="sent60">``Original Extra Stout'' contains only carbon dioxide, causing a more acidic taste.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent61">Contemporary Guinness Draught and Extra Stout are weaker than they were in the 19th century, when they had an original gravity of over 1.070. </span>

	<span id="sent62">Foreign Extra Stout and Special Export Stout, with abv of 7.5% and 8% respectively, are perhaps closest to the original in character.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent63">Although Guinness may appear to be black, it is officially a very dark shade of ruby.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent64">Guinness and health.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent65">Studies claim that Guinness can be beneficial to the heart. </span>

	<span id="sent66">Researchers found that antioxidant compounds in Guinness, similar to those found in certain fruits and vegetables, are responsible for health benefits because they slow down the deposit of harmful cholesterol on the artery walls.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent67">Guinness ran an advertising campaign in the 1920s which stemmed from market research -when people told the company that they felt good after their pint, the slogan was born  - ``Guinness is Good for You''. </span>

	<span id="sent68">This type of advertising for alcoholic drinks that implies improved physical performance or enhanced personal qualities is now prohibited in Ireland. </span>

	<span id="sent69">Diageo, the company that now manufactures Guinness, now says: ``We never make any medical claims for our drinks.''<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent70">Some vegetarians might object to Guinness as the production process involves the use of isinglass made from fish. </span>

	<span id="sent71">It is used as a fining agent for settling out suspended matter in the vat. </span>

	<span id="sent72">The isinglass is retained in the floor of the vat but it is possible that minute quantities might be carried over into the beer.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent73">Varieties.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent74">Guinness stout is available in a number of variants and strengths, which include:<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent75">In October 2005, Guinness announced the Brewhouse Series, a limited-edition collection of draught stouts available for roughly six months each. </span>

	<span id="sent76">There were three beers in the series.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent77">Despite an announcement in June 2007 that the fourth Brewhouse stout would be launched in October that year, no new beer appeared and, at the end of 2007, the Brewhouse series appeared to have been quietly cancelled.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent78">In March 2006, Guinness introduced the ``surger'' in Britain. </span>

	<span id="sent79">The surger is a plate-like electrical device meant for the home. </span>

	<span id="sent80">It sends ultrasonic waves through a Guinness-filled pint glass to recreate the beer's ``surge and settle'' effect. </span>

	<span id="sent81">The device works in conjunction with special cans of surger-ready Guinness. </span>

	<span id="sent82">Guinness tried out a primitive version of this system in 1977 in New York. </span>

	<span id="sent83">The idea was abandoned until 2003, when it began testing the surger in Japanese bars, most of which are too small to accommodate traditional keg-and-tap systems. </span>

	<span id="sent84">Since then, the surger has been introduced to bars in Paris. </span>

	<span id="sent85">Surgers are also in use in Australia and Athens, Greece. </span>

	<span id="sent86">The surger for the US market was announced on 14 November 2007; plans were to make the unit available to bars only. </span>

	<span id="sent87">As of 2011, however hard to find, the surger is available for purchase both for bars and regular customers.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent88">Withdrawn Guinness variants include Guinness's Brite Lager, Guinness's Brite Ale, Guinness Light, Guinness XXX Extra Strong Stout, Guinness Cream Stout, Guinness Gold, Guinness Pilsner, Guinness Breo (a slightly citrusy wheat beer), Guinness Shandy, and Guinness Special Light.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent89">Breo (meaning 'glow' in ancient Irish) was a wheat beer; it cost around IR5 million to develop.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent90">For a short time in the late 1990s, Guinness produced the ``St James's Gate'' range of craft-style beers, available in a small number of Dublin pubs. </span>

	<span id="sent91">The beers were: Pilsner Gold, Wicked Red Ale, Wildcat Wheat Beer and Dark Angel Lager.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent92">A brewing byproduct of Guinness, Guinness Yeast Extract (GYE), was produced until the 1950s.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent93">In March 2010, Guinness began test marketing Guinness Black Lager, a new black lager, in Northern Ireland and Malaysia. </span>

	<span id="sent94">As of September 2010, Guinness Black Lager is no longer readily available in Malaysia. </span>

	<span id="sent95">In October, 2010, Guinness began selling Foreign Extra Stout in 4 packs of bottles in the United States.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent96">Pouring and serving.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent97">What Diageo calls the ``perfect pint'' of Draught Guinness is the product of a ``double pour'', which according to the company should take 119.53 seconds. </span>

	<span id="sent98">Guinness has promoted this wait with advertising campaigns such as `` good things come to those who wait''. </span>

	<span id="sent99">Draught Guinness should be served at 6C (42.8F), while Extra Cold Guinness should be served at 3.5C (38.6F).<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent100">A pint of Guinness should be served in a slightly tulip shaped pint glass (as opposed to the taller European tulip glass or 'Nonic' glass, which contains a ridge approx 3/4 of the way up the glass). </span>

	<span id="sent101">On the way to the tap, the beer is passed through a chiller and is forced through a five-hole disc restrictor plate in the end of the tap, which increases the fluid pressure and friction, forcing the creation of small bubbles which form a creamy head. </span>

	<span id="sent102">The glass is then rested until the initial pour settles, and the remainder of the glass is then filled with a slow pour until the head forms a slight dome over the top of the glass. </span>

	<span id="sent103">.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent104">Canned Draught Guinness should be poured into a large glass in one smooth action, while bottled Draught Guinness should be drunk straight from the bottle.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent105">Sinking bubbles.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent106">A long time subject of bar conversations is the Guinness cascade, where the gas bubbles appear to travel downwards in a pint glass of Guinness.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent107">The effect is attributed to drag; bubbles that touch the walls of a glass are slowed in their travel upwards. </span>

	<span id="sent108">Bubbles in the centre of the glass are, however, free to rise to the surface, and thus form a rising column of bubbles. </span>

	<span id="sent109">The rising bubbles create a current by the entrainment of the surrounding fluid. </span>

	<span id="sent110">As beer rises in the centre, the beer near the outside of the glass falls. </span>

	<span id="sent111">This downward flow pushes the bubbles near the glass towards the bottom. </span>

	<span id="sent112">Although the effect occurs in any liquid, it is particularly noticeable in any dark nitrogen stout, as the drink combines dark-coloured liquid and light-coloured bubbles.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent113">Culinary uses.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent114">Guinness is frequently used as an ingredient in recipes, often to add a seemingly authentic Irish element to the menus of faux-Irish pubs in the United States, where it is stirred into everything from french toast to beef stew.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent115">Advertising.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent116">It has been said that Guinness uses the harp of Brian Boru as its trademark. </span>

	<span id="sent117">However there are differences between the logo and the Brian Boru harp. </span>

	<span id="sent118">This harp, dating from the 14th or 15th century, which is on view at Trinity College, Dublin, has been a symbol of Ireland since the reign of Henry VIII (16th century). </span>

	<span id="sent119">Guinness adopted the harp as a logo in 1862; however, it faces right instead of left, and so can be distinguished from the Irish coat of arms.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent120">Since the 1930s in the face of falling sales, Guinness has had a long history of marketing campaigns, from award-winning television advertisements to beer mats and posters. </span>

	<span id="sent121">Before then, Guinness had almost no advertising, instead allowing for word of mouth to sell the product.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent122">Guinness's iconic stature is partly due to its advertising. </span>

	<span id="sent123">The most notable and recognisable series of adverts was created by Benson's advertising, primarily drawn by the artist John Gilroy, in the 1930s and '40s. Benson created posters that included phrases such as ``Guinness for Strength'', ``Lovely Day for a Guinness'', ``Guinness Makes You Strong,'' ``My Goodness My Guinness,'' (or, alternatively, ``My Goodness, My Christmas, It's Guinness!'') and most famously, ``Guinness is Good For You''. </span>

	<span id="sent124">The posters featured Gilroy's distinctive artwork and more often than not featured animals such as a kangaroo, ostrich, seal, lion and notably a toucan, which has become as much a symbol of Guinness as the harp. </span>

	<span id="sent125">(An advertisement from the 1940s ran with the following jingle: ``Toucans in their nests agree/Guinness is good for you/Try some today and see/What one or toucan do.'') Dorothy L. Sayers and Bobby Bevan copywriters at Benson's also worked on the campaign; a biography of Sayers notes that she created a sketch of the toucan and wrote several of the adverts in question. </span>

	<span id="sent126">Guinness advertising paraphernalia, notably the pastiche booklets illustrated by Ronald Ferns, attract high prices on the collectible market.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent127">In the late 1980s and early 1990s in the UK there was a multi-award-winning series of ``darkly'' humorous adverts, featuring actor Rutger Hauer, with the theme ``Pure Genius'', extolling its qualities in brewing and target market.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent128">The 1994 -1995 Anticipation campaign, featuring actor Joe McKinney dancing to ``Guaglione'' by Perez Prado while his pint settled, became a legend in Ireland and put the song to number one in the charts for several weeks. </span>

	<span id="sent129">The advertisement was also popular in the UK where the song reached number two.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent130">In 2000, Guinness's 1999 advertisement Surfer was named the best television commercial of all time in a UK poll conducted by The Sunday Times and Channel 4. </span>

	<span id="sent131">This advertisement is inspired by the famous 1980s Guinness TV and cinema ad, ``Big Wave'', centred on a surfer riding a wave while a bikini-clad sun bather takes photographs. </span>

	<span id="sent132">The 1980s advertisement not only remained a popular iconic image in its own right but also entered the Irish cultural memory through inspiring a well known line in Christy Moore's 1985 song `` Delirium Tremens''. </span>

	<span id="sent133">Surfer was produced by the advertising agency Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO; the advertisement can be downloaded from their website.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent134">Guinness won the 2001 Clio Award as the Advertiser of the Year, citing the work of five separate ad agencies around the world.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent135">In 2003 the Guinness TV campaign featuring Tom Crean won the gold Shark Award at the International Advertising Festival of Ireland, while in 2005 their Irish Christmas campaign took a silver Shark. </span>

	<span id="sent136">This TV ad has been run every Christmas since 2003 and features pictures of snow falling in places around Ireland, evoking the James Joyce story The Dead, finishing at St. James's Gate Brewery with the line ``Even at the home of the black stuff they dream of a white one''.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent137">Their UK commercial noitulovE, first broadcast in October 2005, was the most-awarded commercial worldwide in 2006 In it, three men drink a pint of Guinness, then begin to both walk and evolve backward. </span>

	<span id="sent138">Their 'reverse evolution' passes through an ancient homo sapiens, a monkey, a flying lemur, a pangolin, an ichthyosaur and a velociraptor until finally settling on a mud skipper drinking dirty water, which then expresses its disgust at the taste of the stuff, followed by the line ``Good Things Come To Those Who Wait''. </span>

	<span id="sent139">The official name of the ad is ``Noitulove'' -which is ``Evolution'' backwards. </span>

	<span id="sent140">This was later modified to have a different endings to advertise Guinness Extra Cold, often shown as ``break bumpers'' at the beginning and end of commercial breaks. </span>

	<span id="sent141">The second endings show either the homo sapiens being suddenly frozen in a block of ice, the ichthyasaurs being frozen whilst swimming, or the pool of muddy water freezing over as the mud skipper takes a sip, freezing his tongue to the surface.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent142">Guinness's 2007 advert, directed by Nicolai Fuglsig and filmed in Argentina is titled ``Tipping Point''. </span>

	<span id="sent143">It involves a large-scale domino chain-reaction and, with a budget of 10m, is the most expensive advertisement for the company so far.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent144">And in 2009, the ``To Arthur'' advert, which started with two friends realising the long history, hail each other by lifting up their glass and saying ``to Arthur!''. </span>

	<span id="sent145">The hailing slowing spread throughout the bar itself to the streets outside, which accuminates to around the world. </span>

	<span id="sent146">The advert end with the voiceover, ``Join the worldwide celebration, of a man named Arthur'' [1]<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent147">The latest advert is a discordic musical inside the pint, with the new slogan ``17:59, it's Guinness time''.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent148">The event is now known as Guinness Arthur's Day. </span>

	<span id="sent149">``Arthur's Day is a series of events and celebrations taking place around the world to celebrate the life and legacy of Arthur Guinness and the much-loved Guinness beer which Arthur brought to the world.'' </span>

	<span id="sent150">It took place for the second time at 17.59pm on September 23rd 2010.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent151">Worldwide sales.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent152">Sales of Guinness in Ireland and Britain declined 7% in 2006. </span>

	<span id="sent153">Despite this, Guinness still accounts for more than a quarter of all beer sold in Ireland.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent154">Guinness has a significant share of the African beer market, where Guinness has been sold since 1827. </span>

	<span id="sent155">About 40% of worldwide total Guinness volume is brewed and sold in Africa, with Foreign Extra Stout the most popular variant. </span>

	<span id="sent156">The Michael Power advertising campaign was a critical success for Guinness in Africa, running for nearly a decade before being replaced in 2006 with ``Guinness Greatness''.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent157">Guinness Stout is brewed under licence internationally in several countries, including Nigeria, the Bahamas, Canada , and Indonesia. </span>

	<span id="sent158">The unfermented but hopped Guinness wort extract is shipped from Dublin and blended with beer brewed locally.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent159">The UK is the only country to consume more Guinness than Ireland, and the third largest Guinness drinking nation is Nigeria, followed by the USA.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent160">Merchandising.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent161">During Saint Patrick's Day outside Ireland, Guinness merchandise is available in many places that sell the drink. </span>

	<span id="sent162">Merchandise includes clothing and hats, often available from behind the bar after a specified number of pints of Guinness have been purchased. </span>

	<span id="sent163">In addition it is possible to purchase branded merchandise online at the Guinness Webstore.<br /><br /></span>

	<span id="sent164">There is a popular tourist attraction for Guinness at St. James's Gate Brewery in Dublin, called the Guinness Storehouse, where a self-guided tour of the attraction starts with an overview of the ingredients used to make Guinness followed by a step-by-step description of how Guinness is made. </span>

	<span id="sent165">After this a pint of Guinness is offered inclusive of the tour price, which you may pour yourself at one of the bars after a short demonstration by one of the staff. </span>

	<span id="sent166">This entitles the 'initiate' to a certificate. </span>

	<span id="sent167">There are videos showing, among other production stages, how Guinness is regularly tested by a panel of tasters and the visitor is shown how to properly taste Guinness. </span>

	<span id="sent168">The rest of the tour includes many things such as the coopering trade within Guinness many years ago, a section dedicated to the advertising and merchandising efforts of Guinness over the years, and a section dedicated to historical artifacts and footage relating to Guinness. </span>

	<span id="sent169">The tour finishes with a free pint of Guinness (if it has not already been availed of at one of the other bars) at the top of the 7 story high building in the Gravity Bar, the highest bar in Dublin. </span>

	<span id="sent170">There the pint may be enjoyed with a 360-degree view of the city. </span>

	<span id="sent171">Two other bars and a restaurant are available to visitors during the tour and a full selection of Guinness merchandise is available to purchase.<br /><br /></span>
